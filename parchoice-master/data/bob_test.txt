oh boy dreaded theory .
*by the way yes that was sarcasm* so yeah got to ucc around 8:30 ... .
especially today ... .
and sleep .
he actually made it seem exciting .
and well our singing part did n't go that bad .
hmm not much .
this right now feels like the home stretch ... ..
i 'll stop with that now .
well i 'm off to sleep now .
then you a word of thanks ...
what other news ... ...
*shrug* it 's math boring ok ?
so we chatted for a bit ... ..
we were so bored we were gon na do this really stupid idea i came up with ... ...
and gorgon !
and then the food ... ..
planning my sunday where it 's gon na be pure postin ' pics and h/w .
i practiced windmills !
i wonder how the semi 's gon na go w/ half of them being 9ers .
`` everywhere we goooo everywhere we goooo people wan na knoooo people wan na knoooo ... .
it 's because most of my day has been in the car .
well not much happened at school today .
and the friendships i can make on the side =p .
well the test was a joke .
so was n't too bad .
yes the quality of my hyperstudio project drops drastically from photoshop to crap pics off the web =p .
but yeah i really feel bad for those people .
but for now ... .
not that i 'm bragging =p .
eventually with the help of mr. dayus i solved the problems ... ..
i concluded i 'll be drawing the 007 opening screen in every movie..
subway for lunch then headed back to school .
and so far my average is 79.5 .
i left after first half ... .
still s'all good .
thought that reading random blogs was more important the night before =p .
jetta killed the little jap lawn mower ... ..
whew i was thinking `` crap ... ...
or worked on assignment , but that 's three words .
i said no because lunch beats starving until ... ..
but fun night tonight .
for some reason today everyone noticed i got new glasses ...
well i was awakened by a sudden stop at a service center .
`` ok go for it jason ... .
i actually heard more than 70 % of it today lol .
but throughout the breaking , not a whole lot of power .
jessica was drawing on the back of his neck and i got his face w/ a whiteboard eraser .
the fruits were good though ...
so after school now ... .
is none other than gerty 's cousin !
but no it was n't .
how corrupt our government is .
330ish ?
now i can watch that ... ..
i shoulda brought theory h/w .
whoo .
pretty crowded out in backyard though .
guess a beer if you 're over 18 .
oh yeah , and after english service ... .
well anyways me and age ended up browsing around for almost an hour and thirty minutes .
handed in two labs , and then prepped for friday 's test ... ..
we went and did research .
i was just doing it to piss him off .
well yeah it was cool to see a whole entry ... ... .
i was surprised how well it went .
home ... ..
it was cool to see all the uwo students back again .
well now after school .
but afterwards , with some talking , i finally really realized ... .
anyways you should read the book if you have n't .
so far our summer seems pretty relaxed compared to school year hype ... .
ugh i really need a more organized life .
the evolution of our political parties .
5/20/04 yay day two of pig dissection !
ate ...
theory , bio lab , read stupid book .
after that ... .
and also i doubt it 'd be that amazing managing two planes to get into the air .
so i asked him if he was muslim .
3 hours ?
sorta lol .
well at the yfc place ... ... .
ugh ... ..
so talked to some other people on the bus ... ..
it 's not bad .
the point where you have to take a pair of scissors , and then break through the ribcage by splitting it right down the middle ... .
so i woke up pretty slowly , got downstairs had a quick breakfast and then got ready for church ... ..
one main thing we did was plan out the rest of hype until april .
only 5 more classes of mccumber oppression !
same for science .
so cheesy .
but yeah hitler never really had a great life .
we whooped some uwo ass though when we played doubles .
no wait ... .
yay !
oh yes and also no drumsticks at the moment as for some reason they 've gone missing .
pool lol .
just before basement jam on friday sure .
boy i wish i had bought sunglasses when i had the chance .
i mean wth ! ? ''
oh yes typing at 90wpm does have its advantages .
so got all that stuff covered ... ... .
mrs. wharton and mr. clark are out in nyc right now , so yeh the music department 's pretty much abandoned for now .
unfortunately i have to agree with him on this .
i really do n't wan na stop typing right now lol .
kinda made fun of chinese food but i had to say it .
programming played some literati on yahoo .
you ca n't ever tell the difference .
now time for some questions to see if you were paying attention .
got to church around 9:15 .
headed out the door for my usual saturday piano lesson .
so from now on when you read my entry ... .
we had a sub though today since ms. wiener 's grandfather just passed away today .
i really ca n't do jack when im freezing cold .
mike was drawing on john 's neck , and eventually john got so pissed off that he almost threw mike over his shoulder .
but yeah ... .
it was 11 so i guess i might as well just have lunch .
well my original idea was to ask them with a voice and have them put up their hands .
until tomorrow 's entry .
while milling away to bio class ... .
after 2 hours though we got bored , so then went and got a lift from dad back to my place .
geez blogs take so much time ... .
beef ... ... ..
the gumballs i shoed 20 in my mouth ... ..
good luck to everyone on exams .
gavin got crippled from running into a wall and getting a door slammed in his hand *ouch .
11 music for theory = ) .
then some sc .
josh usually is pretty serious w/ work .
ok i did n't joe fail ... ...
and then sleep i went = ) ...
so after my class at kiwanis , where i reign semi-victorious ... ...
figure this mite help a bit =p .
anyways today my whole family went to lcac instead of mom going to north park , and we went to pick up jason then head to the church .
i should have a theme song and a stunt double for this sort of action ...
and lots of crappy mistakes .
basically i wasted 40 minutes of my morning doing jack , however harsh sounding this is but yeah i myself felt that worship this morning was not what any of us hoped for .
we get pitted against one of the finest crews in london .
and if it was referring to that .
and i can do it kinda consistently too ... ..
i mean doin ' worship at times , ushering , etc .
never giving up on the english ministry .
well now trudging to science ... .
this is where i found out i got a good mark on midterms .
this video i 'm guessin was made in 98 when bill clinton had the affair w/ lewinsky .
well i 'm out .
so unpredictable .
interesting too i guess ... .
this is a big jump from 72 % mark in november .
so yeah i did n't do too bad .
lots of talk about the big trade the leafs and rangers made .
ooooh yeah and then came the thing were we could only have this amount of certain parts of the body touching the ground ( i. e. 20 hands , 10 feet and 2 elbows ) .
blast i 'm alone .
in the end i ranted a bit about why i sorta changed my mind on job career path from cga to something different ... ...
but yeah singspiration went fairly well from our point of view ... .
with all the jokes and stuff .
amongst the fighting over radio station between patrick and i , and the constant debates on why rock music can suck sometimes ( lenny kravitz=sucks ) we finally got to school ... .
anyways other than that not much else happened .
maybe i 'm going to far but yeah just somethin ' that adam said that inspired that hehe .
grrr !
i 'll make this fast .
really sucked but still point is it was an assembly day , meaning that my classes are shortened .
wonder if calls to toronto are local .
i accidentally sorta forgot *sorry man if you 're reading this* about waiting for him , and well he decided to bus on his own and show up at my door ... ... ...
since i guess we 're lucky we did n't get bronze .
but we won be default since hammond just ripped shots through nikki lol .
well we got to school around 8:10 ...
anyways before i rant anymore about the later part of my day let me summarize ... .
dave was in the other room playing his true crime file , and yeah that was basically what took up most of the afternoon .
then got the joke finally w/ the slightly poor quality techno produced by homestarrunner .
he 's cool ...
monosodium glyceride ... .
yeah i 'm probably going to be cramming for most of tomorrow for this stuff , plus a biology test on the digestive system .
it grazed her lol not hit but grazed .
you could tell pokan was a bit unorganized as he somehow thought 25 % and 75 % would turn into a 7:18 ratio .
hmm ... ...
b-droids was only open to people 19+ so we still had a small session .
our church 's english/youth ministry has never been better i think .
well we decided to wait for hammond actually at first cuz he was gon na come *which he sorta did at the end but webstation was full and we ended up at webstation so hammond could n't find us* and we saw lindsay murphy and giles .
yeah played a few rounds of that ...
well somewhat reliable=p .
it is pretty fun too sometimes .
good lesson though nevertheless , with lots of talk about our friendships with one another .
after that i decided that i 've been sitting in front of the comp too long .
it 's about 12:30pm right now .
but yeah today was usual , played music , mr. mccumber i think had therapy or something ... ..
and sent out my mediocre attempt at graffiti-ing to some of my friends .
i basically just improved on rollbacks into forearm and some footwork .
and senior band folders are immense .
it worked !
so i did my daily morning routine , and decided i 'd shave .
you kno it 's a good book when .
i guess removing the workshops really had sometin ' to do with it .
really was a great feeling .
the workshop that i ended up in somehow was # 19 which is a two day track .
in that very watered-down example from an explosion you learn not to tinker with a can of metal that looks like a bomb that says `` nuclear bomb '' beside it .
was too attentive trying to explain the whole park to patrick .
i had a real urge to start drummin ' .
i can get a platter of fried rice for the price of a footlong sub .
actually i like his teaching style better ... ...
so after lunch math class .
after the study ... .
wow i 'm horrible still haha ... ..
stupid sun .
you know , like clock would be `` shmock , '' guitar would be called shmuitar , and modem would be `` shmodem , '' which we cracked out laughing our asses off when we figured out what word it almost sounds like .
well today ... ..
* well in ms. manson 's history class it was same old .
which i thought pretty much sucked .
well anyways i 'm out for the night i guess ... .
you 'll know our idea=p .
we kinda merged classes in the end and that was the main highlight .
after playing bf and bfv played some quake iii .
straight from god .
since i was born lol ...
my day 's actually been non-stop `` action '' if you will say ... ..
yeah and my iverson questions are basically ruined for now .
personally though i never said it ... .
so much stuff ... .
well we ate lunch what else ?
mitch just stares at it ... ...
now off to english .
she 'd actually be a good mixed doubles partner ... .
and jason went onto alienware and made a 17,000 dollar comp lol .
1/2/04 first day of new years : work and some chillin well , after the party ended @ 3am , i went home , talked on msn for a bit , then went through a relaxing 10 hours of sleep ... ... .
i never knew it was this small until today .
how it 's in my school .
so do n't judge a book by it 's cover ... .
yeah a few of us will be late for various reasons *work , huntsville , etc* and the confirmed start time is 7 .
learned about `` similar '' triangles today .
i need to learn some better techniques and just work on my sticking .
i like it mostly because it 's telling god to prepare the sanctuary for you ... .
yeah i 'm out for the night .
lab 's due thursday ... .
this morning i woke up late ... ... .
so yeah ... ...
anyways we did prayer before we started service ... .
lol that was the climax of my school day , just watching finlan being plowed by mr. d 's post made all the gr .
amazingly .
the dictorial attidude of school will be forgotten for 24x4 hours '' =p .
and what the lord left us after leaving for heaven again ( holy spirit ) .
slow moving morning .
yes this is why i stick to doubles .
now i got ta spend another 30 bucks buying a new drumhead .
well maybe if we do n't have careers and civics we 'd save $ 5,000 for paper .
she choreographed her own dance routine to outkast 's b. o .
wonder how they are taking exam week in .
but it was a pretty good day still ... .
ate basically .
ooooh boy i really have a crummy memory lol .
and this is who i voted for ( do n't shoot me please ) : minister of communications : tehmina the two social directors or w/e : melissa and teefy yup ... .
though it was used who cares it was in good condition .

my day started off like usual wednesday morning ... ..
later .
jason came over for a bit too ... .
we also did some work on depression era , and ms. manson talked about gr .
oh yeah and my daily cup of java too .
10 w/ a ticket i 'd have sold mine .
get it ?
it was kinda cool though how earlier that day in sunday school the speaker that came in to talk to us ... ..
whoo i was n't the last one =p .
and then after that while explaining our lab , ms. wiener would for some reason make a sound effect for everything she did *example following : * after taking the mouthpiece , *yoink yoink* you can then clean it in the ethanol just like this .
words of praise .
praise practice , adventure of getting josh 's stuff from ucc parking lot , and hype ... ..
also heather was telling me about how she had everything for semi ... .
in the end it all tied together .
basically ... .
i wish my basement was hardwood flooring .
omg we got owned lol .
so one hour passed by real quick .
except for the exam .
she had lots of stories ... .
verses 1-34 if i 'm not wrong .
yang also came for a bit too but left early to study for bio .
summarizing : the presentation by me , robert , adam and everett kicked ass .
yet they tell us not to bring electronics .
so yeah this dude does have his place in lcac .
always tempted to watch the leafs being massacred *how 'd they shut out ottawa ?
crap i still have music .
history we basically just did review ... ..
well i guess that 's it .
get set ... .
lunch : mike , john and i headed down to galleria where i got that breakfast thing from international soups like usual if i go to galleria .
i was gon na watch game but meh sc caught on ... .
well yeah ...
but guys doubles is much more fun and action-packed .
* wow took forever to decide where to go today though .
senior band was much more interesting today .
so if i 'm lucky i 'll be stuck at a 78 yet again , and if i say do do amazing on final assignments then maybe i 'll get back to an 80 ... .
near to impossible .
grrr no wossaa !
me and calvin vs. steve and sergei ... ..
lots of trouble lol .
mr. mccumber was actually normal for once and did n't pms ... ..
to hypers : sign up in our new site : urllink lates .
or if you want a big boost for me .
for example ... ..
as well as gavin ... ..
i 'm horrible at it lol .
every political party started out either as a crazy dude expressin ' his thoughts and people are appealed by it or out of the blue a group of people get peeved at an issue and then eventually somehow evolve into a party .
wow .
got a ride from mophead home afterwards .
especially since today 's a day two .
since now there 's no snow bank to be pushed in , and we all know if we push each other in mud , the other guy 's gon na die once the muddy dude gets back up .
sweet ... .
free time !
except i actually tried to listen to the lyrics .
tomorrow ... .
i mean religion ca n't be forced which liam pointed out ...
world '' rectal rangers ... ..
sumair was his name , and he was a muslim before converted , which i find really cool .
*shudder .
i finally decided to get off my lazy butt somewhat and actually do something =p .
heehee no school .
apparently me and calvin were pretty much the crappiest crew there ... ... .
so yeah i think the two booklets from my workshop ( give me oil in my lamp ) are gon na be used throughout this year a hefty bit ... .
we could n't do anything with her watching us .
my eye was swollen through that whole time .
just the fact though i had to write another stupid essay about `` prohibition affects on canada . ''
afterwards ... .
now personally up until now i still do n't consider it `` stealing '' but he did .
i also officially found out ... ..
you know , cuban missle crisis ?
their food is startin ' to really be good ... ...
it 's a bloody hallway .
it 's actually pretty good place .
reminds me of the time when patrick told me he read in the car for 4 hours *who the heck would read the caesar 3 manual ?
so mr. campbell came into teach us today .
conclusion : central junior badminton 2004 : not very well trained .
com .
we finally got into the car and off to gavin 's ... ..
well i 'll explain now ... .
and it pisses me off how i probably wo n't be doing june exam but doing february exam just because of stupid techniques n stuff .
did n't sound bad actually .
10 miniscule field of vision .
except this time no see-fu !
also most of the time we just spent exchanging matchmakers and looking at each other 's .
the dream interpreter i mean not the one that mary was married to ... ..
i wonder if sta sucks this much this year ... .
but when it came to shoveling the crap at the end of the driveway that merry old city of london happily shoveled on ... ...
yeah i was kinda surprised that happened since well ...
well we then got out the balls to play after bout 20 mins , and then shot around for about 5 before dave and jacob came .
played some ps2 w/ kendrick and josh .
* whitney : guys ... ... .
but church is always a great way to start a new week ... ... .
so after service , we headed downstairs and just chilled for a bit .
bedside fellowship was at our place , and so we chilled for a bit , just talked about our day , and also had some prayer time in groups .
josh came down again after our loss to sta ... ..
well today we got assignments back , talked about our test on thursday *yes i have two tests on thursday* plus a lab due for next day ...
and managed to actually listen through three cd 's .
probably more usual things ... .
but yeah it was pretty funny at the moment until he stayed on the ground for 10 mins .
math class we did n't do much ... ..
i mean it 's sorta almost a sport .
the whole thing about the movie being touching to the stage of making you cry , personally i did n't think so .
pokan found out icy 's password for friendster , and then was gon na change it ... ...
so basically all class we looked through all these newspapers about cartoons .
as i shut the ps2 while it was saving causing a corrupt file to emerge .
well ... .
ate , dressed , u know ... ...
grrr !
which like i said we blew total crap .
and we did some really pathetic playing at the end ...
supposed to be a combination of resident evil 4 and silent hill 3 .
much more open than usual which was pretty cool .
so yeah i ca n't post up my gruesome pics of the dissection .
then again ... ..
not bad considerin some of em have had their site up for over two years .
music class was pretty funny though .
so after eating that steak ... ..
i could be `` jumping jaguar joe . ''
you ca n't go wrong with quotes like that .
i kinda well ... ... ... .
yes i realize that my biological clock wo n't just listen to me but still just getting that comment out ( come on ...
at first we all thought it was another one of those 10 min jams caused by some car going dead on the highway ... .
numb lol .
later .
and once again the camera fest we had since 3 of us have cams , so yeah we took lots of pics..
kinda makes me consider psychology a career route = ) .
nor was it a relative from hk or sometin .
well anyways today instead of mr. dayus we had ... ... ..
other than that we also passed around our booklets ( for me paper pad since i forgot booklet=p ) and just gave our emails , contact ways , and also words of inspiration .
hehehe we play next week ... ..
but yeah ... ... ..

i sat around for a bit ... .
and calvin was playing with his usual candy wrapper .
so yeah got ta start on homework and stuff ...

whoa !
and this was basically where my day ended .
just talked about how they failed .
hmm ... ... .
what a weird combo it is .
a well-known subject that has so much related to it that re-learning it over 100 times still has n't hurt .
she 's always `` good . ''
6/30/04 spiderman 2 : eeh ...

balled for a bit on paul 's old net , drummed , sc , h/w , and tonight watching the calgary vs. san jose game .

washed it down with some wine and stuff ... ..
just before the rec leader was 'bout to use my cam , i just yelled `` everyone fob style '' and everyone put out the peace sign lol .
turns out she just needed to know the conflicts that badminton conference will have .
picked up jason then headed to church .

whoa look the fish eats the plant , then gets eaten by a bigger fish , who gets eaten by a shark , which gets eaten by man , which gets eaten by a camel !
and we play in teams .
so in piano today , we were going to run through some pieces , until i opened my big mouth and said i have some pieces for school where i 'm accompiniament for other people .
was basically an extension of sermon .
mitch kinda went overboard and made a movie-script-like thing to go w/ his lol .
my day started off at 7:50 ... ..
i ate , played a wee bit , then left .
i mean it does sorta look like fruit punch* and also few of 'em liked my favourite part with the `` wiggle your big toe . ''
miss m then came into our classroom and handed out huntsville itineraries , and also hunted down the people who have n't payed , and also talked to us about how we got ta sign up for a bus..
with lots of yelling of random movies ... ...
their main outline is messages in the morning , then from afternoon to night it progressses from soft rock to heavy metal/ more modern stuff .
but practice was fun .
thompson was reading another magazine earlier *another one like cosmo or ym* and then when he 'd stop to read certain articles , mitch would just reach in and like feel up the picture of like a chick lmao .
and just had some time to relax , chill out and reflect i guess .
trombones sound good ^_^ and like usual mr. clark yells at woodwinds .
i said hey , but then had to help set up the sound system for the weekend for the seminars and workshops that the adults had .
just wait 'll tc 2005 ... ..
so got ta get home hehe .
math : reviewing for exam ... .

and this was where i was thinking about suggesting a relocation of the church .
then one game of big 2 .
i mean just some things i remember off the top of my head ... ..
oh well ... ..
hope they remember us and hype =p .
which was about voting ... .
lots of talk about last night 's hockey , you know about the leafs losing to the senators and the avalanche stealing a win from dallas .
wo n't say much about that ... ...
also i seem to have trouble making 3 's ... .
i can link extremely ugly windmills !

mmmm ... ... .
meh beats being pessimistic though ... ..
wow .
this situation is so ugly ... .

causing ms. wiener to once again poke fun at my zoning out at the wrong time .
hmm ... ..
and then patrick called and said he 's not going to school today .
`` one word to describe it .
i actually felt awake for once .
canadian pm makes 140,000 a year for sitting on his butt appointing people to do stuff !
