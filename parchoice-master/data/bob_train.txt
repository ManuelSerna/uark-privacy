got him goin on with that for almost ... ... ..
well yeah now it 's final ... ...
that was the main climax .
we talked about battle of britain today .
logged on msn for a bit and checked my blog 's g-bookie .
but it did seem like an hour though .
then i would do morning routine and be met with a breakfast of leftover roast beef from yesterday .
no projectile vomiting ( yes ! )
monica and some other girls presented today .
i just thought of that actually just now as i was busy working away at my church 's presentation for worship tomorrow .
tehmina then notifies me that i should beware when i go to room 301 since apparently mr. pigeon was pretty pissed off today .
so grabbed my gatorade , raquet , and headed to game 1 of the day : central 1 *me and john* vs. cch 3 .
gols , tanks , men , everything .
this was the sheep `` biting '' the shepherd .
but yeah speaker was pretty cool today .
there 's always people saying how the bible 's `` contradictory '' but honestly i have never seen it happen before .
just wastes more time ... ..
now i got ta wait another year for tc . ''
like i said before though ...
mike got the sweetest meal ... .
day two was n't filled with too many of my trigger happy camera pics ...
first time i 've used it for more than 5 minutes .
i really need a drum teacher , or take the time to make up some new beats .
nothing happened so i guess that it was ok lol .
and courtney let her pms out on thompson again .
what a joke lol .
now # 1 *over silent hill 3* on my most wanted games list .
probably failed because i kinda did n't do the homework =p .
but honestly some asian chicks lose like 5 inches when not wearing shoes lol *not that i 'm including you gerty or joy =p .
done exams and long weekend !
had some excitement if not a lot .
that pretty much says everything for math .
but all this would turn in a matter of seconds around lunch ... ..
it was said many years before this would happen .
for some reason though they have intermediate and 9er band playing next friday .
the water noise i can make w/ my mouth *for those that know what i mean* i can make it hitting the top of my head .
i slept for the majority of the early evening .
oh yeah and right around now ... ... .
you 're cut ! ''
10 kid w/ 30 % body fat .
but anyways enough with that .
well at least we can bring in notes for reference ... .
i liked today 's day in church a lot ^_^ .
and then lunch .
this is jahoravich dingleshmienz reporting for the national inquirer . ''
and back in grade 7 and 8 me and some people kinda went ww2 trigger happy after enemy at the gates .
i spent around 40 mins cleaning and waxing my board ... ..
maybe 30 ... ..
later = ) .
eric bennett then outta random said `` mr. gilbert your hand looks bony on the overhead . ''
played some songs ... ... ..
but it 's also kinda cool to see so many people have visited my site over the last few months .
* stupid gas prices .
and onto the rest of my day .
but i ca n't think at midnight ... ... .
mine kinda did ...
except for music playing test after 4 grueling days of hardcore examinatiosn and studying ... ..
it 's like the total opposite of my windmills=p .
no you ca n't !
found jason *we were a bit late but we lived* then quickly ran to the train .
it was pretty quiet ... .
did n't have much else to talk about , and wendy decided to lead us into some games .
fun .
and that would be the only thing i 'd eat until i got home .
we had terran wars *all of us were terran including comps .
but honestly i 've come to start to really get more involved with my church lately .
who cares ... ... ...
but meh 78 i 'm not complainin ' .
i probably chinese failed ... .
anyways , mr. gilbert was also pretty funny today .
but point is it was the 3rd day .
well sorta 5 .
not the first time either , which i 'm thankful for = ) .
lots of stuff was thrown in .
first thing anton brings up was that prank phone call they made about 2 months ago w/ an arnold schwarzenneger voice ... .
lots of little kids ( priscilla , heather , and their little posse ) and some other random kids that i barely know .
aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh whooooooooo asldfliatoia htoiahghasilf oshg hgdb hfh ggh dfjgh f hyjgjsfdtjsdaoijshjd ; lfgh l ; ksj hoiah fihga hfoijh jg g jgjpo ! ''
but i will still push forth and complete this post =p .
later people = ) .
then after school met up with dan for ucc .
here and huntsville , both times after two hours or less we go insane .
blogging has basically become part of my life now ... ...
so left around 845 ... ..
no good jokes , no fighting , no icy vs. pokan brawls .
sight reading it *since he played it last year .
got home and then ... ... ...
and to close it off was us ...
i looked like a crack addict splitting up a soda cracker into 4 piles of crushed powder with a ruler .
but since i was done ... ..
but oh well , least i ca n't be blamed for selfishness , i decided not to buy one just to hopefully let another gr .
oh wait was it even on ?
cool actually ...
i found dave and tommy sitting at the front so i sat with them .
but instead badminton and piano theory .
well anyways summary of my day as usual ... .
as you can see i am not much of a scorer , but i play defense a lot .
here 's the detailed summary ... .
oh yeah today we did n't do much since we had elections for grade reps. lots of people were running this year , so after careful deciding *two i already decided earlier and one random one* i decided to elect in fred wu , amy chick and burke adams .
both ways ... ..
i think i failed =p .
and of course the rest of my day =p `` happy birthday icy ! ''
i do n't know why ... ..
heh have n't had pizza in a while ... .
eew what was i saying ! ?
my morning will be at the social justice now conference ...
we 'll be missin ' em a lot ...
not processed chicken meat with breading .
hopefully i can make this happen unlike last year .
and then get in groups to make a skit .
ok i 'll just summarize history and civics .
mmmmmm .
maybe .
stupid timmy 's not letting me win .
shweeeeeet !
finlan got a 65 .
to ... ..
i can see why josh and calvin were pretty much anticipating my loss .
so waking up at 730 ... ..
i had some trouble at first because hotmail is the most retarted email program in the world .
* i really liked that analogy .
well he did ... .
i like to sleep ... .
well after offering and benediction no song of respone since dave had to leave ... .
basically we started settling in for our 20 hour stay lol .
i quickly got ready for school ...
but we are now known as the only team to have scored 3 points on them !
we had a bible study for interactions 2 , and did skits of genesis lol .
the senior band .
we learned turing imaging more .
it was pretty effective .
well i 'm gon na go study a bit more ... .
my day was ... ... ...
well we did a quiz ... ...
and now ... ..
well the car ride home was pretty boring .
so i go shower , then ate my breakfast from good old mcd 's =p .
*shrug* well after that headed around the school ... ..
then came summer .
while the rest of us stayed for benediction and some special deacon/elder announcement .
steve , igor and lance came too , and some other people as well .
good reminder that no human or satanic force can stop you , when you have jesus christ backing you up = ) .
mike did too .
then bennett , then me , then maggie ... .
and mike was annoying john like usual , and vice versa , and i now am improving w/ factoring ^_^ .
i woke up at 11pm ... ..
but yeah here was the outline basically of how my last day of school went ... .
which i now really think was n't worth an hour of me watching .
now i 'm going home .
and then some music history !
bio class was not productive ... ... .
i won !
well anything does really lol .
and that pretty much halted my train of thought .
hmm ... ..
hermann `` accidentally '' smacked thompson while he was drinking his coffee .
i wanted a red one ... .
wow .
with a life like a high schooler ...
yes i 'm finally done !
we are on our way home ... ...
now we sit in the movie .
bused home w/ dominik , ryan and underhill .
well yeah announcements came on and off to careers ... .
stupid sam zhang !
so in the end she did all the gas filling by herself , and then while heading home ... .
really text-like memories .
but yeah lately i 've been having really strange dreams .
wow was n't that an exciting turn from my typing=p .
hmm ... ..
my whole after school was quite a blur .
after mass pokings , i notice the ferrero rocher chocolates did n't have the stickers ...
yeah that is basically one way of looking at prayer .
so yeah in the end i did n't wake up early , and left at the same time as usual .
gaaaaaaah his eyes are in pain !
i mean it 's like any other day ... ... ..
net ) .
i was just real surprised that they were there lol .
tehmina , rachel , underhill , okanski , drew , tanis , like i said a lot of us .
ms. manson kinda yelled at us because apparently some people were doing work from other classes .
and of course 1991 original loft .
but when i went downstairs to get my bag ...
blogging , eating , multitasking like my usual self hehe .
yeah that took up most of the lunchtime .
so we all headed downstairs after benediction ... ..
mom had to drive some people places and then we headed home for lunch .
so yeah ... .
i 'd rather figure out what `` a '' equals to than looking at two almost identical shapes , calling them congruent or not and then getting it wrong because i was off by half an inch or something .
but indoor soccer had its time at ucc after school .
we all had fun =p despite the fact my eye looks like an apple lol .
yes back from sessioning .
coffee tasted like coffee ... .
so getting that by , me nate and mike ended up going to stobie 's today ; a place i have n't been to since last november ... ..
especially canadian history .
first thing that was when i re-dedicated myself to god ... .
so today we did a bible study on wisdom in relationships instead of improv night .
though i think i did n't do good on it i really do n't care .
i mean the talk we had ... ..
wow ... ..
soo ... ... ..
congrats to steph though ... .
umm ... .
i found out i really did forget lots of shit ... .
lol .
and somewhat useless also ...
we are still aiming for the goal , and if we are strong enough *look at this from football or spiritually* we will break through all obstacles and succeed .
1/10/04 yes weekend ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
people actually hit the bird .
but i forgot the title ... .
but yeah then we headed to the train stop ... ..
jesse wong came back for a day !
wow it 's already 12pm .
me and josh just sat around listening to music , while dave and gavin were talkin ' in the back .
we 've changed ... ...
he used to teach at banting or sometin ... ...
food looks good upstairs hehe .
my day started at 730am with josh 's dad waking me and gavin up .
and yeah this will help plan future things like say ... ... .
really boring .
yeah like i said today was n't that excited ... ...
but now stereotyped w/ red hearts and cinnamon candies shaped like hearts , when really the heart would never look like a ... ..
i did n't die ... .
because personally i liked the strings and the choir was ... ... .
to think the dude used to come to sunday school with us .
wanted to know if i could head to his house for a bit to hang out n stuff .
i only read books i really enjoy .
apparently jason did n't know that , and he paid for himself anyways .
lol the day when gavin `` judo kicked '' a cinderblock haha ... ..
so yup ... ..
so anyways the people i voted for 2004-2005 were : secretary - lindsay brown $ $ $ people - niki n ' caitlin vp - helen kneale the co-p 's - christian and geoffrey those are all the positions ... .
grr stupid p3 emachine ... ..
to `` cope '' with `` grade 10 intelligence '' he started writing stuff very slowly .
and that is always one heck of a fun time for both my spiritual growth and meeting new people .
takes like an hour to beat =p .
meh , not like i really care .
i still do n't get why the heck people do n't just use msn .
civics class ... ..
oh yeah we also got our marks updated .
lunchtime played some crap ass ball and also broke my glasses in the process .
basically gavin dragged me out of bed today , so yeah i trudged upstairs , had a breakfast of pizza again , and then did daily morning routine and headed out the door for tc day 2 ... ..
he crashed 5 times and paul nor adrian ever told me how to fly a plane lol .
and were pretty peeved cuz of it .
when i read that on the back of my bookmark today ... ..
glo , me , simon and niette doin ' worship this week .
whoo .
maybe 3/4 of our class showed up .
* yes it is quite depressing ... .
sweetness though ... .
it was n't too bad .
i liked the week .
was actually kinda weird seeing him there then gaming with him .
so yeah note to self and other badminton players in london : saunders , banting *no offense lina=p* and oakridge are horrible lol .
basically at the inn again ... .
some of the kids went home and the others went w/ jt , brian , kendrick and felix *brian 's friend* to fast eddie 's for a quick meal of grease platter and bubbly water with much sugar in it *aka burger n ' fries and pop .
i mean spiritual highs are always an issue , and i mostly prayed about that , plus for myself also to be able to listen more to god instead of always asking and me always doing the talking .
hmm i 'd be stuck watching the flames , leafs , and flyers .
well ottawa i wanted to win just to piss off the many leafs fans in my area , but canucks and devils not making it in i really did n't think was cool .
from a wee little crescendo to a note tapering , mrs. wharton could point out every mistake you could think of .
my afternoon of going to buy some new shoes maybe plus maybe a few new clothes was kinda foiled when no one could give me a lift lol .
but in the end the music one got cut off ... .
only federal do less actually .
pretty fun night .
i do n't know when the other two went to sleep yesterday night , but i slept at ... ...
he was on the government side and said a statement supporting opposition lol .
today actually was n't too bad ... .
listening to music .
chris after service basically nagged at us for not looking over it .
also could n't score many points as shooting from the perimeter ...
yeah big old tree .
so yeah i 'll have some time to kill in this old hick town .
but at the same time i guess it was just this week ... .
i 'm getting bored from typing it even .
11 groups had really good ones .
you know they look the same but ones bigger than other ?
but i guess just the pace of the class has kinda made it seem boring .
or maybe c. both ways ... ...
i know this entry 's kinda bland ... ... .
i ca n't drive straight because i turn too much ...
*shrug* i guess ca n't be that bad .
socializing w/ christ ?
to summarize up my day .
there 's an idea for next time lol .
mentally lol .
but i still do know how much he suffered , and paid for our sins in the form of the worst torture known probably to man .
kill bill *again .
* programming ... ...
though ms. mitsopoulos kinda embarrased herself when she let the tuner go off during mr. clark 's speech lol .
maybe the government should begin to give us less homework =p .
although my best friends list is sorta weird .
and they did say it .
* carmen taught cici hot to tickle me ... .
it was a pretty cool change though .
and they were gone .
the idea of helping and getting something in return ...
teacher : did you see god ?
well my second bag in four days broke .
other than that ... .
since i had to go get ready for the spring teams assembly or w/e ... .
basically today at lunch : john : man ... ..
i have no clue .
well after that boring class came lunch .
mmmmm pasta ... ..
shanghai noon !
well 'till the end of the school year .
i 'm still stuck in good ol ' londontown for weekend ... .
that 's as far as i 'll go for now ... ...
this is including band stuff and my regular stuff .
ish .
so today in music class some woman came in to sub for wharton since they did n't get back from nyc until 2am , but unfortunately this teacher does n't know jack about music .
so yeah i really liked today 's lesson also .
i ca n't really say what happened on the road as i slept for most of it .
not much else i can think of ... ... .
hmm well now i 'm just waiting for the colorado and sharks to face-off on thursday night .
sho lame .
mrs. wharton is still not back .
like i was saying earlier though ... ..
learned about gov't more ... ...
mike did n't come and neither did hermann .
i 'm slowly getting the concept .
tonight no ucc , no nothing .
and hermann was 6-0 also .
oh yeah tried cracking one or two lame jokes too lol .
midterms in a matter of two days .
come to think of it ... .
basically just chatted around since it was her first `` full day '' back .
had pizza today .
they were going out to somewhere to eat ... ...
well ... ...
i do n't mean to sound mean ... ..
but that was n't the main thing i was amazed at ... ..
but yes unfortunately we do have school still , though today was kinda fun ... .
which by the way i called him in the morning but no one answered .
i 'm a non-jewish christian .
i got off at sarnia and castlegrove like usual .
i still got 102+ to go through still for gr .
dunno what grade she 's in if i 'm not wrong i heard she 's in gr .
good reason at least .
`` it truly makes me think of the fact that god does love everyone ... .
not bad for first time playing lol .
since summer 's coming too i have more time = ) .
and english .
sorta .
reading 's becoming a decent pastime now =p .
the whole day today though ... ..
i really am happy for the changes that have happened to my church .
workshop we learned about prayer today .
other than that ... ..
hmm ... ..
you know ... .
crap on fm96 ...
but yeah today was fairly interesting ... ..
i do n't know .
hehe forgot=p* so now heading to school ... .
like the following : whitney : lindsay can i borrow your cosmo magazine ?
math we had a quiz .
first stopping by a mcd 's for some lunch and then on the highway .
kinda intersting though ... .
more turing , more crap .
but hopefully he likes the gift i gave him .
and then headed into history ... ..
so funny watching dave play though ... ...
no oatmeal this morning , but something filling .
no way !
3/26/04 well deserved weekend after long week normally i do n't mind school as much as the people around me ... .
so boring .
well since he taught us most of the motion unit so far , we do n't know much , and most of us did n't do amazing on the science quiz we had .
while doing that i was talking on msn , chatting w/ maisie about speech impediments ...
but yeah after the more socially scrumptous meal ...
so right now ... ..
test ... ..
he had to take some other people too , so yeah the trunk was quite crowded .
also i have the same teacher .
but this week has been really hectic ... .
laughing and happiness only increases your life span =p .
lol .
i amde 4 close ones and many misses .
this morning started off with senior band ... .
but it was pretty cool lol .
got ta sleep for tomorrow .
8 technique .
yeah but i 'm gon na miss those uwo kids ... ..
she got to go to a concert led by the one and only chris tomlin !
and i should be decent at it =p hmm ... ...
it 's bigger , louder , and cooler .
so yeah instead i 'm gon na just go session tonight .
mostly about how gr .
or the time when i saw my english congregation at church spreading to many people in the community .
got further in silent hill 3 .
it was actually pretty fun .
the biotechnology corp .
so got home ... .
chinese checkers and win that .
i hopped off of the stage and *snap .
actually ... ... .
spent 50 minutes making one image !
the meeting of new friends , tc rec games and of course ... ... ..
i forgot what a spleen was .
landed back on his head .
but transition into we wan na see jesus lifted high ... ..
well the person that came to our church yesterday from grace fm sure was right .
like i said i slept early last night ( 11pm ... .
in fact , his father was so amazed he became christian also .
wow ... ... .
so arriving back to school ... ... ... .
and oh yes jt 's friend came too ... ..
not the chocolates , capitalist commercials or cadbury creme eggs .
i dunno who else but god could really help me at this time .
ouch .
yeah congrats on gettin married =p .
math class ... .
ok so i 'm not at the wrong tc lol i finally see people that i remember from last year .
ugh the movie 's so good just watch the whole thing .
it 's a given my average will be over 80 ...
apprently chris is n't doing it this week , so only me , gloria , josh and gavin were doing it .
hmm ... ...
to serve the lord and let the congregation have a sense of unity when we are praising the lord .
yeah i thought badminton was lazy sport apparently they have drills for us too .
much needed work .
mixed four different kinds ... ... .
and mr. brown subbing for civics is pretty funny .
er more of news articles of what news might have been back then when christ rose .
anyways after watching the close game , ending with a field goal from the patriots , gavin josh jason and i left in brian 's car for home .
i then look down on mine ... .
he left around same time .
well at 1pm i finished , and well i had to go photocopy some stuff ... .
final evaluation ...
have n't had it in a while and it still tastes good =p .
he kept wondering how we write stuff if we do n't have an alphabet lol .
that 's basically my day ... ... ..
the thought of going to band and attending history class completely blanked out of my mind .
and gave us this acronym to remember it : honesty open direct they all sorta mean the same , which is sorta like the trinity of christ .
oh yeah and made some jokes about if hype had initiation : `` dear *insert name here , * but due to the lack of good grades , you have been placed on the hype waiting list .
she kinda fell asleep ... ..
after the service *which lina said actually was n't that bad* we headed downstairs for refreshments .
decided to cut across train tracks ... .
and then chatted around a bit before class started .
wow i ca n't wait till chinky new year now ... ..
tried out bf vietnam ... ..
getting home ... .
finally !
before that though ... .
hmm today went to get glasses after lunch , came back for some sc , then went back out to pick them up ... .
so yeah today was kinda cool at church .
well we left around 2 and got home around 2:30 , dropping off jason on the way and also picking up bad boys 2 and tony hawk 's underground from rogers .
got him then quickly drove to gavin 's .
that 's getting kinda old .
wan na see what the game 's like .
so yeah ... .
jasper 's has waaay more food too , plus they give discounts to central students^_^ .
i hopped into kendrick 's car along with dan , jason , and gavin and we headed to bkung 's place .
but soo warm ... ... ... ...
i just love learning about the music periods *not .
not much else just pure laughs hahaha .
lol it was a funny class though .
english we read more .
o0o0o0o what ?
so yeah i 'm probably gon na spend my few final hours in toronto now packing , just chattin ' wit people from tc on msn , and of course play a bit of g-cube and just talk with josh and em .
we basically reviewed for the math test on thursday .
history actually was n't that bad though .
many of us thought it was a waste of resources .
but i wonder if i 'll get that piece of copper signifying i got over 85 average this year ...
yeah today 's lunch really sucked ended up studying .
i mean the first time you bake a chocolate cake will always be worse than your 10th , 15th , or 30th time .
came the sermon .
senior band..
so yeah i did that today w/ dan and marcello basically for four hours ... ..
so we made $ 2.80 profit ^_^ .
only 3 people in the class tonight .
champs and foot locker mainly .
or a project .
that 's pretty much it .
and it is a very personal thing .
put it this way it looks like a celery ... .
and i can kinda study during careers i guess .
then again it 's an indication its halfway through the week ... ..
and we had lots of jobs .
4/21/04 personal kiwanis achievements : 2nd and 3rd = ) hmm ... ..
but we eventually got there on time .
and think deep inside *aww nuts* but reassuring myself *joe you may have chinese failed ... .
and then revealing the atriums and ventricles ... ... .
but most exciting part of day today was probably the sudden change in the afternoon from breakdancing to seeing a movie .
finally reaching science class , i finally get to see the portfolio that underhill typed up for our bio project .
a bumble bee comes by ...
got ta sleep now though ... ..
we butchered it a lot with stupid acts like sinking our own boat , fighting each other and roadkilling one another .
the video ... ...
except his is nba and mine 's nhl .
hmm 30 minutes or so and then finally got to the bus stop after taking a few unecessary turns .
tonight i really got ta sleep early for exam tomorrow .
so yeah today i do n't have much to write about .
never noticed it till today lol .
but i prayed about it , and prayed for the lord to please drive out any demons or old sins stuck in my head to be cleansed out , as most of my day has been revolving around that since i re-dedicated this morning .
but before that ... ... ... ... .
they are twisted .
oh yeah and lina 's name reminds me of my remark of how `` hot chocolate is for wimps '' lol .
i had a bagel .
not much here -science : booooooorrrrriiiiinnnnng ... ...
well when i got out finally after wasting the extra time and reg .
yup ... ...
steph came afterwards too to help .
wonder how i 'll blog for that day .
i dunno what they really did ... .
lol so yeah after going through that confusion ... .
been learning this since grade 7 .
which i 'll list now were answered : -how come it seems sometimes lcac never grows ?
programming : self explanitory .
reminds me of back in grade 3 though when my whole street used to play road hockey .
someone is just a bit greedy about fame .
we realized somethin .
some dude in gr .
so now to english class ... .
but yeah it was speaking of the word of god with the famous line `` in the beginning was the word , and the word was with god , and the word was god . ''
well after the sleepover yesterday , which consisted of stepmania , gunbounding for dave , and watching david get the crap scared out of him from silent hill 3 ( a phone rang and it literally killed him lol ) .
but anyways ... ..
well after service , talked with the hype counsellors about when our meeting would be ...
and i was happy it was day 1 ...
this one movie about this cop being stalked and something about `` how can you track it when it 's tracking you ? ''
but meh still played a game of sc w/ jason and drummed for over and hour .
lol kinda funny to imagine that he 's now my hype counselor .
like the feeling of `` oh i know them ... ..
all that except game 7 of stanley cup finals maybe =p .
and got other things done =p .
rather buy silent hiill 3 , or grand turismo 4 when it comes out .
funny though since nate burned heather ...
kinda woke up late today so did n't gel hair or anything .
i 'm happy though that when kendrick came , we all just got to sit down and talk about it .
25,000 new pencils .
but really i do n't like tuesdays ... ..
so basically i did n't sleep until 'bout 2am last night .
wow cga pics .
40 days hehe .
leavin ' w/ these words : `` for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son , that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. ``
turing was somewhat challenging but i 'm happy that we learned it .
beats french vanilla .
i mean jake should be cut if we cut people .
of ... .
but yeah the lesson i liked a lot .
do n't really know her name ...
*shrug* i just put down random formulas for that .
and in mexico apparently you can do it on the streets .
ham and cheese sandwich .
or that ms. wiener was old .
as i take it ... .
this tc kinda sucked i could n't even make it to day two ... .
aww nuts i still have to do that canvassing thing .
* yeah so from 2-6 ... ..
studied for midterms @ lunch .
the movie bombed ... .
yeah i find long time devotions really is effective .
and oh yeah thompson ... ...
bit different today .
honestly i did n't sing as much as i prayed .
i also had margarine for cooking oil ... ..
and i still need to do a few papers lol ... ...
beats last year at least ...
i do n't have much to say for that time because i was half asleep .
plus i got ta make some point form notes for tomorrow since i 'm speaking up there about my experience at tc this year .
taco bell .
entry # 72 ... ...
the score : nathan 4 , thompson 1 .
bleh after some running from victor hunting me down and also avoiding being chased down by his camry ... .
i seem to play better ball fooling around =p .
`` where romeo at ... .
really smooth .
oh well that 'll come in time hopefully .
and so to our 2nd game : central 1 vs. holy cross 1 ... .
we played this game where we were spit into `` villages . ''
well what happened today .
also chatted with the few people i knew there *no one from theory 3 why ! ?
that pretty much sums up my morning ... .
we 've already had over 4 sub teachers this year .
well yeah had lunch , then math .
my second pair of glasses have just died ... .
summarizing my day in one word would be `` shweet ! ''
it 's unfortunate how much difference one day can make .
my money !
well i was gon na go home , but then spencer found me in the halls and said him and igor were gon na session .
i was actually hungry for once .
yes ... ... .
but it 's nice to see how fast he 's started his walk of faith .
wow i have n't had a saturday like this in ages .
ergh if floppy diskettes could hold more than 1.4 megs ... ..
it was about how intercourse is really a gift from god that should n't be altered from its status .
which i forgot to get 15 bucks from dave .
so yeah it was kinda hard waking up at 8am on a saturday , but i managed ... .
and now i 'm off to sleep .
well when he was baptizing people in the jordan and baptized jesus and how he came to fortell the coming of jesus .
and we went back on with our chatting about some things more happier .
we went to one quad meet and *poof* we are in 8th place .
today actually did n't go too bad .
unfortunately everyone was already doing stuff ... ...
and lo and behold gerty was on .
i just got on the bus .
i think 8am and my day started right then .
but yeah picked up gloria , then picked up jason .
chinese new year was today ... .
and we picked up nfl street on the way from his house .
tc 2005 ... ..
programming class we had a test ... ..
then went to bio when the bell rang ... .
on msn .
ugh can she ever shut up ... .
time must move on i guess ... .
but yet they are fun ... .
* and of course who could ever forget music class ... ... .
even though it got off to somewhat of a rocky start , the end result of today was pretty interesting .
most of it was pretty ez actually when i think about it , the only hard question was the one about time spent in different cell division phases .
well better summarize this quick .
well i 'm out .
problem ?
sorry people = ( .
i 'd never wear something like this ... ...
wow ... ...
so my day today started with the awakening of me around 7:20 or so .
one song sounded like crap ... ..
considering for the whole time i was coughing , sneezing , sniffling , and having a head more stuffed than a ... ... ... .
yeah my mark is n't exactly the best ... .
schooled oriol 's band .
no good music on this morning .
also he had a very interesting story about faith .
she said the book is ok , 2nd one sucks .
they started just before we slipped in .
so ate quickly , and ran upstairs again to have some free time before our final bible study for the night .
quickly ran upstairs and took a 1 and a half hour nap .
lucky they worth almost nothing .
so yeah march has been a good month ... ..
too bad canadian subs closed ... ..
other than that ... ..
it was speaking of a man who had no one to turn to , and how he was fairly depressed .
wait i think his first name was len .
yeah first off to explain why i have n't blogged .
photos photos and more photos .
school is so boring right now .
afterwards they also took us up to the chapel for a small talk , where i met daniel trinh .
woke up ... ...
that 's basically it .
i hope mr. gilbert does n't screw up his teaching like last unit ... .
3/27/04 badminton , piano , worship practice , church sports night !
about spiritually preparing for battle and how to be careful of using our gifts ... .
not exciting ... ...
but then afterwards ... .
real cool girl .
we went from local stars to nhl ... .
procrastinated piano ... ..
but in the end now i am basically part of the senior band .
then called hammond to see when my exam time was .
yes he was sleeping .
english class ... .
yeah we imitated that lol ... ... .
and nathan still ranting on about the `` got a dog ?
how nice of them=p .
subway ... ... .
and i strongly urge people to ... ... ... ..
later .
holy crap !
the liquid board marcello 's selling is tempting ... ..
and then i left .
well actually this one was kinda amusing ... ..
so i decided to go on a scourge building frenzy .
* hopefully summer i 'll be able to find a teacher .
yup senior band again hehe .
no badminton practice today , except some of the team went to a quad meet at sta .
but now i 'm dying in english .
apparently much of the class likes my little creation there haha .
kinda rushed through the end but meh .
i normally sleep to 730 ...
and then thought `` ok ...
i ate from international soups .
finally got home ... ..
i woke up to the sounds of rapper 's delight the original one .
and then off we were .
pokan , hermann , eddie , steve , mike , ally and her posse of people , jessie , wilson , brescia , and i think the girl 's name is suzie ( spelling ? ) .
surprisingly ... .
lol .
kinda defeats the purpose of gourmet italian dining .
i should be done soon though ... .
i woke up around 8ish today ... ..
but by 2nd and 3rd game i managed to get my serve up and actually tied from 14-8 .
hmm ... ... ..
did notes .
for the next `` x '' amount of weeks our human biological clocks are basically set forward an hour , meaning we have to reshift our body 's adaption from winter .
you then put pressure on it ... ..
and apparently mrs. mitsis has a whole plan to have me conquer gr .
yeah that 's right josh and gavin i was early for once !
but while they were taking out the baby they kinda pulled out her intestinal tract by accident *shudder* or sometin like that and the fact she was hemorraging afterwards , and had to go through er .
i 'm a liberal .
* so worship started at 9:15 like usual ... ...
i may be bloggin day by day still =p .
so then we stopped at angelo 's ... .
bio class ... ... .
i went from 2 hops for crickets to 10+ .
slept -hype @ carmen 's place ...
played some sc , did some homework , and of course ... ... .
so all that effort ...
problem is : it 's room 314 too .
i mean even in the bible joseph did with the famine in egypt back in the book of genesis .
lol so yeah thompson kinda look like he wet himself ... .
and the guitarist is amazing too .
just buy photoshop ya cheap school !
there was another movie ... ...
life 's been a bit hard lately like i 've said .
once again ... ... .
so yeah there was one highlight ... .
i 've come to the conclusion of i hate friggin power moves !
i 'm doing praise this week !
the kid spent up to 2am making the powerpoint ... .
and then we went to a winter sports team assembly .
so we quickly grated some cheese , put them in the oven ... ... .
got a lift back from him ...
average day lasts from 6am-11pm .
106.9 i just hate because it 's non-stop rap ... .
and then there was really good pasta , meatballs *mmmm* and of course the average canadian dinner roll .
it is not a substitute book for a bible .
which i find interesting ...
yeah just a bit stacked .
so ate breakfast , did usual morning routine *earlier than usual* and then tried to kill sometime ...
for once i had a relaxing day .
exactly what we wanted all yesterday ... .
i ate food .
read some new book i got on my own ... .
did n't really do much at lunch .
i get better at breaking =p .
so good .
apparently he made a wake up call for us .
she at least knows how to keep a class happy by serving oh henry bars every once in a while .
got lectured ... .
and of course magical button pressing from josh =p .
so meh when you have a cellphone ... ... ..
oh yeah , hell 's been freezin over for a while well ... ...
not very exciting ... .
they mostly sucked .
got piano theory and stuff tonight .
but yeah ... ...
yeah i know , it is n't the biggest resolution , but it 'll take more than being sick from `` da been lo '' to keep me from going to day 2 this year =p ( it 's almost been a year and well whadya know i still have n't forgot it ) .
you can be a good missionary at god 's will or you may be an ineffective one if you are doing it at your will .
the movie though started off almost right from jesus ' arrest .
when someone told me a helen neil was looking for me or something .
payed for theory .
ate quickly , dressed and ran out da door by 7:50 .
that would be nice .
music !
got overrun on omaha like last time .
yes i play bass trombone now .
programming ... ..
marijuana legalization , same sex marriage , euthanasia , and some other ones .
anyways i got ta go start the slide show for sunday ... .
which i have to say blows ass compared to bf ... ... .
4/12/04 aww ...
civics .
now i 'm really tired ... .
just that this week has gone by real slow .
i personally liked the looks of this one game coming out .
i think i 'm gon na turn out to be one of those caffeine addicts soon .
the idea of christ being my lifelong vision ... ...
blast .
waaaaargh !
but the night was insanely long .
but the other people ... ... .
hmm not much else ... ..
then left .
processed cheese ... ...
i still had fun .
then again i 'd rather live in this era cuz back then i really ca n't picture traveling at 40km/h in a model t ford .
we got tied for silver with other two groups .
and here i am ... .
more piano ... ..
well after that i watched gi jane .
another beginning for another week .
really scary ... ... ... .
first it tastes like crap and who really want 's to eat microwaved tomato sauce ?
not much else to say .
never really done this before .
he has food .
bummer , wanted them to get by the wings .
the new most awesome game in my mind : battlefield 1942. or c generals .
is n't that whack ! ?
or at least some place closer to home to eat .
started off with him going by himself to photocopy his own copy , the mr. g told him to photocopy him one ... .
was thinkin bout playing ball but half da gym was taken .
unfortunately in the end after much confusion and getting some people pissed off *i think half the class wants to kill me now =s* we finally managed to find a winner .
foooooood^_^ .
had to wait till 3 before it started though since they had one more coffeehouse audition .
do n't blame him though ... ...
grrr ... ... ..
however jason would do the same but i would n't know .
i mean it 's recorded they did it ... ...
first thing that happened was band .
we finally arrived at church at around 830 ... .
* that then made me restart my compy , and also downed my uptime for my comp .
we watched a pretty interesting movie though .
but i do n't exactly have 10k handy so no .
co-op is so much fun .
btw no i was n't thinking about this in jasper 's if you 're slow .
this room is actually very chaotic .
funny stuff ... .
and a relaxing day 1 it was .
more of sadness ... ...
great recovery .
and my group really is `` productive . ''
basically .
since it was basically showing britain 's glory .
you know , the ctrl+f feature *find feature* in your internet browser .
that was basically it .
new haircut lol .
i had some very strange dreams last night .
i manage ... .
our beginning was a bit rough ... .
like always ... ..
and apparently mr. clark did think we sounded good out in huntsville .
-got home .
to end this entry ... .
and now for my exciting story of my stinkin ' eye exam .
i figure if you really are a christian you know that you are going to go to heaven .
cya .
i was happily going about on my 1st day back from long weekend , until i walked into my english class .
long days may have more hours , but that just means more stuff to do hehe .
gavin and jason ... ..
so did some cardio ...
passing ?
did some sessioning .
holy crap 7pm already ! ?
*josh and joe just look stunned* josh : *ehem* yes gavin london has a subway system using every mac 's variety store as a subway stop .
it really was something special .
yah right at the beginning of the book ...
if you wan na just read about my after school day , scroll down to near the 3/4 mark or so .
first up to the plate ... ..
lol .
beats williams .
big improvement .
yeah i really feel like a secretary right now ... .
* english ... .
no harm done though ... .
so yeah there 's always next year i guess ...
well to the other parts of my day =p .
that pizza pop around 3am did jack .
talked a bunch of other stuff too ... ..
the first few metres , for a 400km bus ride that will be memorable for a long time lol .
mine 's just a little over a month ^_^ .
yay another thing we were n't late for !
meaning i have history first period .
ugh was so friggin ' annoying since my batteries were on low so i had to be very conservative with what pics to take lol .
so finally made it to gavin 's *trying to make this blog speedy got ta get sleep* and started planning .
and have enough energy to actually hit the keys on the piano so no wakey wakey until 9am today .
forgot who i said he looks like but he looked really funny .
and i could n't breathe going down biology hallway ( pig dissections i think ? )
and learn how to establish a democracy .
sweeeet .
i wish they did .
well who cares about that now ... ... .
yeah by the end ... .
* lucky i have a spare strap .
wow the list goes on and on for stuff i want for 2004 .
a very precious commodity during high school and university ^_^ .
so when i found out that my compy presentation was a openoffice file ... ...
and we sound like crap .
well there 's always visiting =p .
eeew i did so bad .
came first period which was ... ..
still got ta do piano which i 'm going to do now .
and i got myself greek-style lasagna and a frappe .
mr. clark has officially lost my practice log , so i got ta find a way to record down all my practice dates now .
cya =p .
we focused on russia campaign and how the germans got their butts whooped , and sicily and how italians back in wwii basically did nothing .
music class ... ... .
i do n't know why ... .
arrived at oakridge ... .
oh yeah talked to jason about buying comps cuz he 's planning to annoy his parents for one .
carmen seems to always be stressed out with like daily homework .
and my music 's going really well .
worse , there was n't any entertainment today .
well today was another tuesday *yay ... .
very meaningful .
well on the way to toronto i was thinking about how our church could change ... .
and this summer we are hoping to develop the 2nd half .
he had spasms all the time and `` volcanic eruptions of anger '' as he describes it .
and now i 'm blogging ... ... .
why 's it stay alive hehe .
congrats man lol .
i can cover up my hair with my hat .
ran over couple of the songs ... ..
yes yet again another traffic jam .
but just before i get to that i 'm gon na start from the morning ...
watched some video we 've watched already and i slept through most of it .
learned something about roots and stuff .
poor kid .
so there ... .
now that 's unique .
bused home .
it was pretty bad for scales , but songs did n't sound bad .
and after that really boring rehearsal ... ..
good day mostly today ... ..
who cares if i did anyways ... .
and then we went into the study for today .
com and looked for stupid words meanings .
and the movie passions , which is coming out february 25th , has brought up lots of issues .
less crap ... .
overpriced to the max .
after a nice 8 hour sleep *below saturday standard* i was awake at 11 ... .
spent $ 8.25 on some stupid sub and a can of pepsi .
well though me and john 's hopes are now crushed for making guys doubles in wossaa ... ..
two weeks or so .
do n't remember much .
yeah your typical joe chan day ... .
there 's still next year ... ...
we headed downstairs to watch my newly bought movie ... .
but enough of the complaining ...
heeheehee shweeetness=p .
well ... ..
and after doing that for about an hour and a half came dinner ... ... ..
no rap group is good enough for it ... .
everyone thought they shoulda got something like a merit ... .
he seemed so bored too lol .
the list of crap that happened to us this year goes on and on and on .
heehee ... ...
first time leading a group ... ...
dinner was like usual ... .
pointless yes i know but meh ... .
anyways i 'm out for the night ... ...
i 'll be busy ...
so go rent/buy it on your own =p .
wow ... ...
i really hope that changes though , as it did feel kinda weird ... .
well turns out after entering two events during this year 's kiwanis ... .
it 's not always bad since ms. wiener is kinda funny .
it 's really good , though i would n't recommend the movie .
the drummer ( ette ) is crazy .
oh yeah also the reading of the magazines .
lots of windmills and flares .
but we did n't know and webstation was full so we ended up at head 2 head which i must say was n't a bad descision .
when you 're going to the deerhurst inn !
around 830 or so lindy came up , and we finished the bible study for today .
we each presented our project for fun .
oh yeah and rebecca 's friend rachel came also .
least i was n't late this time =p .
well took lina and j home ... .
well now to programming .
i really do n't care for practice time .
jeff was there , jesse , wilson , erin , brescia , these two people in grade 9 that apparently knew paul nielsen .
i 'm amazed my marks are still so good even though i sleep during 50 % of the classes lol ... ..
hmm ... ..
after accomplishing that task , i then headed back to school with pourier talking about how we shoulda got a gold ... .
he knows that when a subject 's boring we do n't pay attention , hence our head gathered no info .
no losers .
hype should have more of these `` meetings '' lol .
well when i got home i moped around for a bit ... .
great feat today performed by joe !
well today was day 3 now of really cold days .
zoned out a bit thinking about some other things ... ...
it 's cool though how the sun 's actually up when i wake up ... .
what kinda exam is this ?
then h/w ... ..
plus i got ta wake up for worship hehe .
sta 's announcements are much different from ours .
i 'll probably add it to the looking back blog also .
mom got back at 5pm instead of target time of 330pm so yeah ... ... .
they 'll be just as competitive as the huntsville one .
but oh well ... ..
customers abuse it ^_^ .
though i 'm doing horrible for badminton last few days .
we ca n't see god because he is n't there .
most of the time was just on work ... .
we read ... ... ... ...
what was that for *punches joe* *joe smacks thompson across back of head ...
it is her story ... .
until the 2nd half where after a short nap i got some energy pumped back in me .
jason changed from his spiffy suit ... .
*two hours later ... .
bio always has something new to learn .
but nooooo ... ... ...
whooooo !
so after some hard prayer , and determination from the student , he broke his drinking habit .
if one sin you commit is worse than the other .
amazed of how east won .
i did well on tests , did n't sleep in classes , got farther in need for speed underground ... ..
lol hilarious .
badminton tryouts today ... ..
we left around 7:55 ... .
badminton ... ... ... .
people disappear ...
on a good roll of exams !
*shrug* what kind of leadership rubric does canada have ?
wow already 1130 .
but they actually started hurting today .
frankly i really do n't care because i was really tired this morning .
so then getting home .
thanks a bunch people =p .
you have to scroll down a bit ... ...
grrr ... ..
i still ca n't believe that valieteri *did i spell his name right ?
i just felt really sick ... ..
i know it can be gross at times but it is still a decent place to go to .
with the bad comes the good also ... ..
shoam .
the habs ? !
so yeah we all pretty much just hovered around ps2 , played nfsu , nfs hot pursuit ii and virtua fighter 4 mostly .
oh yes how could i almost forget ... ... ... .
and i actually felt refreshed from a good night 's sleep for once .
*why are those people taking stuff from that car ?
so after that grueling nap i headed to my last piano lesson before the holidays came by .
grr .
oh yeah handed in practice log also ... .
sooo much more fun than intermediate band .
these last few days have been pretty fun though , with kiwanis and everything .
called jason on our way there on cell .
and just hung around for a bit .
then we passed a rogers wireless store .
so instead ... ...
wow two minutes before the bell sorry .
-leviticus 19:18 sometimes when i think about christianity ... ..
math : trigonometry .
nothing new .
*shrug .
only to meet freezing cold winds .
so guess now i 'll be headin ' to bed .
the list goes on and on ...
but yeah i did some thoughts on it a while back , and i just find it pretty cool how isaiah was already so enthusiastic about doing such works .
he came a few times before but i really think that we should be able to do our own worship within our own church .
but hey it was pretty funy =p .
it was kind of interesting though dissecting the heart .
burned leen goe .
and i went upstairs to grab a bite of lemon meringue pie .
`` yooooo ! ''
lucky bum .
whoo hoo early dismissal tomorrow !
idiot .
later .
* naw j/k i do n't even have the voice to make one lol .
i mean i 've seen that happen before ... ..
in the end though chatted w/ marcello who came for ball , and saw dan and adam there also .
ugh so friggin ' sticky .
head 2 head i do n't think will ever get boring ... ... ...
and also playing 4 on 4 full court ... .
but meh s'all good i 'm only just trying to find some time to really cram in some theory ... .
hmm it 's gettin better , my post play is actually not that bad .
well i still got lunch tomorrow ... .
aww crap lol .
it was bound to happen sometime ... .
played some mixed doubles game ... ..
i mean ... ...
the most outrageous battle in the whole competition .
* what a horrifying class .
instead of the proposed lab for today ... ..
so much stuff to do and all ... .
and it ended with us whooping them .
we had a guest speaker ... ..
basically my afternoon was pretty fun .
but admist the fatigue , then i thought `` hey why not play some squash ? ''
haha hope you did took me 3 minutes to type *oh no !
timmy 's donuts .
or develop em i will lol .
such a crappy project but *shrug* lol .
i talked a lot in this lesson .
oh yeah and 70 % of the team are asians ... ...
not that bad of a day .
truthfully ... .
well yeah we basically did that until 11:20 when we started walking to school then .
do n't have to crawl outta bed @ 7 or anything .
like usual i gave patrick a lift to school and we just got there on time =p .
so he flew solo today .
i think that tomorrow morning *sunday* is one sunday that i truly need to clear up my mind .
anyways ... .
sorry but it 's kinda true =p .
so dumb , but at least it was open book .
english class , since it is the most retarted class in the ontario curriculum , i 'll just summarize briefly .
5/22/04 day 1 of may camp *and getting there* so the morning after friday ... .
so yeah we learned about that , and then went to the assembly ...
blogspot .
2/22/04 tired ... ...
do n't know what i 'd do without that =p .
oh well ... .
drive was worth it .
cam was kinda put on the spot lol .
tommy : yes little girl : do you see the teacher 's brain ?
but some issues really do bring up questions .
so much more i guess .
talked to ryan , steve , nikola , milosz and some other people for a bit before the exam .
and then met up with the rest of hype for the movie .
chatted w/ nick and meaghan for a bit ...
and now i go do h/w .
and 90 % of them are fobs lol .
then i lost lol .
and friday ... ..
the strap on this one broke piece of crap lol .
today i managed to start the day off at 7:30 .
then got home .
but after we got bored of the fighting , drunk fighter , crashing , shooting , poor driving and nos , we then turned to the one and only scary ( and i mean damn scary ) game of ... ...
`` no wonder why work today was so weird . ''
which was ridiculous .
meh ... .
after an exciting week like that ... ... .
i think i went overkill .
oh wait there is no lunch for me today ... .
me ? !
had some pretty good points though ... ..
`` hey mrs. wharton when are you going to get back from your surgery ?
final worship/praise= ) .
no matter how wrong life can look at times .
later .
`` hermann notice how all the athletes are headed left . ''
so much work to do today ...
*1.5 hours later* quickly did theory ... ... .
java .
yes people started pouring into my house .
but yeah made fun of hammond on the slopes a lot to get back at him for the punches and stuff on the bus lol .
*wump .
got ta head to bed soon hehe ... .
mr. boldt was the weird person he was ...
lotta people anyways .
well before headin ' out the door ... ..
so much for canvassing .
* lunchtime ... ..
but ms. manson still has to mark the essays .
and she had to bike in it .
this really sucks .
anyways ... ..
so finally rushing to the social sciences centre , i run up the stairs , make a few complicated turns *all this is without my glasses so i can barely see signs since my glasses broke* and then finally ... ..
it 's a start ... ... .
probably biggest blonde moment on this vacation lol .
later .
he 's actually pretty good w/ the clarinet .
i know !
but i 'm sorry i cause a distruption ... ...
we programmed .
my feet were getting pretty cold to so i thought `` why not try it '' lol .
wow i feel like those surgery shows on tlc .
marcello n ' dan got a lift from me while age had his mom to give him a lift .
i agree .
well after finishing the 4 page long email *combined both my part and josh's* we emailed it out .
well signup started in rm .
as if it has n't came slow enough .
with me , gavin and steph leading worship ... ..
also today in history ... ..
zoned out reading revelation .
and i was suffering in there .
the club : everyone else . ''
meh more business and it is for a good cause *and it was really worth it .
porkchop* and of course ... ... .
whoo hoo another quiz .
just blinding .
and upcoming for the night : studying for history/civics test , math h/w , and science and bio if i can get to it .
oh yeah but while on the subway ... .
it 's actually better than subway in a way i think .
he got a lot of disses thrown behind his back lol .
he was asking me about what semi was like last year for the ride to school .
was pretty entertaining lol .
* actually the car 's not horrible .
well victorious over 5/7 people i stop by subway to buy my lunch then head home to pack my things for school ... ...
hmm also kinda interesting how 30 people still visited my site without me updating .
*ahem* here it goes .
i 'm not doing exam in june .
no one can see it , but they can sense it ( smell , and just by attitude in reality ) and also you feel pain ( `` the raccoon is now rotting and eating at your skin '' quoted from pastor bartha ) of the sin .
but yeah ... .
see my day was pretty boring and relaxing today .
probably from when i dropped them on the ucc floor but no one knows ... .
and now i am writing ... .
yeah pretty b/s i know ... ..
well off to hype .
so stupid .
oh well have n't seen those people in theory for a week ...
it 's happenin ' right now .
not much amusing stuff happened at lunch ... .
well ... ..
what else happened at ucc ?
mr. richardson was back !
and bus ride home talked to dejan and elaina .
yeah before anything else ... .
we found it , then went home .
yeah i started practicing trombone and stuff ... ..
i 'm actually getting better and stuff ... ..
we did a really dumb worksheet about quadratics .
so instead of getting a lift from him my mom had to drive me to school today .
then again sewer gas exploded under galleria so who knows ... .
so we got some rehearsal done , and we still meetin ' up sunday mornin ' @ 8:15am to finish it up .
sorta .
no way !
i never really napped on the way to huntsville ...
well josh talked about the vision of heaven that he had a while ago .
11 accounting = ) .
and then left for lunch ...
1/1/04 fresh start to a prosperous year ( well kinda fresh start ) who woulda thought ... ..
funny watching though .
hmm after history ...
and then i just thought `` ok it 's been 30 minutes ... ..
and used peter 's denial of jesus as an example .
one song that really hit me was probably `` be thou my vision . ''
we watched a very stupid video .
we really just chatted around ... ... .
just did music exam then went out for afternoon .
nor god 's .
i 'm like a uwo student ... ..
it was pretty bad .
smart kids huh =p .
what a bargain for us lol .
and rebecca st. james had an awesome dance song `` reborn . ''
then slowly ... .
`` etc .
but me , jason , and some other people decided to hit the x-box with gotham racing and nba street .
hmm then dinner .
then programming .
anyways yeah we crammed for the whole lunch which was only 45 minutes since its early dismissal today .
s'all good though ... ...
when i bought it in gr .
giving new believers bibles .
well my day 's been somewhat amusing i guess .
they sound pretty twisted though .
one , since im doing the chinese communist revolution , i found out that mao somehow thought there was a government called `` democracy dictatorship . ''
86 % on my math midterms !
and of course mike and his rants about the knights .
augh it 's postponed again !
i really do believe in that ... .
get ... ..
in a christian 's life ... .
*shakes fist* why must nhl playoffs be now ! ?
so yeah once again ... .
it 's lame ... .
gon na fiddle around with site more maybe .
very wired lol .
i actually felt well slept when i woke up at 630am today .
had some food and then time for sunday school .
while in the library , chatted with brescia , made a few more notes , and then ran over them .
*running to guidance office ...
wow ... ...
it seems kinda weird ...
well at first we sounded good ... ...
7-8 and also watching band of brothers helps you learn much about wwii .
thing is though this time he was tellin ' us about how he afterwards prayed for each of us to either experience or envision god in another way .
*shakes fist .
uhh ...
find out ... ..
er more of an architect .
er actually provincial in senior and then it 's over for me and high school badminton .
and talked about haunted stuff .
got sleep last night , and everything ^_^ .
as you can see my day turned out decent .
with the people that won it giving acceptance speeches instead of `` voting for them '' speeches .
oh yeah which takes me to the original true message *i think : * for the final message pastor bartha spoke much about sharing christ w/out fear , and this is going to be something that will affect my life for sure .
well combined into one gigantic piece thing .
subway !
yeah so i thought i 'd add that ... .
so first i 'll cover dinner .
so won that ... .
sad ... ... ... ... ... .
where i found out my lung capacity really sucks lol , and then started taxonomy .
spirituality especially , is very difficult thing to interpret .
also it 's at my house ... ...
flutes and clarinets sound good now though ... ..
food ... ... ...
i really like this new station .
blast it finally comes .
while on the highway , talked for a bit , mostly about my plans of making a bridge to stretch from hk to vancouver for easy driving access between the two cities , ate , and after feeling full from a good grease platter i decided to sleep the rest of the way ... .
then we headed downstairs and ate some stuff before class started ...
ate breakfast ... .
milled about .
today was a really long day .
but i liked it .
they really need to find something to occupy their time .
* heh without jason there , me and calvin ruled the courts haha .
took lina back to her place and now i 'm back home , watched the leafs lose , did some math , and blogging .
jason called once ... ..
watched some family guy , piano for 15 minutes then ... ..
i still remember in september when we were filed down to auditorium for that motivational speaker .
two returns then wham the third one my raquet flies and it makes it over !
and for some reason mr. mccumber seems to think quarter notes and eighth notes are threatening during rythmic dictation .
now apparently one 's a bisexual while the other is a lesbian who loves to play poker and bring elephants into town .
well i 'll figure that out later .
seriously you do n't think it 's food right ? ) .
but i was surprised at the maturity of the students from central on our bus at least .
ever hehe .
so those meats they sell at meat shops labelled `` lamb '' does get business from some places lol .
and so the countdown begins ... ..
guys bball , girls v-ball , and hockey of course .
you wonder why canada ca n't afford an army .
oh yeah then i saw lots of people from david 's church ncac .
wow a 20 minute slumber ... .
i do n't know if it was but just to me ... .
5/4/04 ah ... .
weird .
i was the only person around my age in the car .
lol .
but mostly there was huge talk about the albino zebras vs. crazy ghost crew battle .
so yeah we made a checkers game .
: thx : np that really is a good definition .
so yeah that was basically badminton summed up .
today was probably one of the best fridays i 've had in a while .
but i know in my heart and soul that that just is n't enough .
after that class ... ..
ca n't wait till that happens lol .
what 's a hyperlink ?
either god may be telling me to evengelize to these people ... ..
drummed afterwards ...
hahahaha was n't late =p .
but ... ..
* that was basically main highlight of programming class .
*zing*
so yeah we got set up and stuff , and actually had enough time to run through all the songs .
i mean just to think i 'm already on entry # 72 or sometin like that already .
no more stupid sitting on the stupid floor .
*shrug* i won majority =p .
quickly grabbed a sandwich to eat ...
and i think teefy was the 5th person played president .
i think god put those laughs in today for a reason , as they really did cheer up my day from the sluggish morning start .
i would later find out that when i got there stefan just let .
well at around 5 we all ran to the caf .
suffer for the next ... ...
the bus ride there and back was filled with many various convos ... ... .
we were grouped into parties and then voted ( ndp won somehow , i was liberal and voted liberal ) -lunch ... .
forgot what i had .
now that place has itself nestled into the food section of my brian = ) .
oh yeah 6 people got sent out at begining of class *lol* that was funny .
lasjhg ahafgh ; asdhgf hl ; !
d student said to me lol .
then okanski started randomly calling drew , pissing him off lol .
so i might as well had slept in 50 minutes and not even bothered going there early .
with the mark i have i dont have to worry about anything .
the sun 's actually up now when i wake up at 6am .
net shots today were actually pretty good though .
yes class today ... .
pizza hut so good .
1/17/04 and snowboarding season has started ... .
he almost got me and thompson simultaneously .
ugh got ta start my slideshow soon , plus study for civics , plus do the essay part of the project .
radio really stunk this morning ... .
naw .
catch up day so i basically surfed the net .
day one ... ...
programming class ... ... .
* some random drum solos and bashing on guitar ... .
i doubt i 'll be able to describe it in blog ... .
and we were on time ... .
math class we horsed around and took up this worksheet .
little girl : tommy do you see the grass outside ?
huh ?
so yeah i 'm out for the night .
and stuff .
so yeah if you people can pray my theory exam goes well for me that 'd be great = ) .
back to good old school ... ..
the one and only ... ... .
we had some sub teacher today that came from russia and taught at pearson for a while .
and lindsay and katie were late .
normally your other ones are kinda you know ... ..
for example , i 'm gon na try to do devos at a better time now and actually spend more than 5-10 minutes , and also for prayer i 'm going to begin to learn how to pray for more than just people i know and me .
3/12/04 and it 's over ... ..
but with that , i still talked to old friends too .
yeah that happened a few times .
h/w .
so suffering for christ ... .
eventually butchered the game in dragging into tony hawk imitation one with stunts like 360 's and flying into a tunnel roof then ramming into a pole .
me and gavin lost to calvin and josh ... .
after getting a lift back home from jason 's dad ... ..
no way !
nothing really amusing happened in class .
did n't chinese fail ... .
tehmina and rachel 's group presented their presentation today on `` the respiratory system . ''
yeah guess that 's it hehehe .
and i intend the same to happen this year ^_^ .
dave got a new raquet , hmm ... ..
why ca n't we get more maple syrup .
but most of all the funnest math unit ... ...
grade 8 ?
and really there 's only about 4 more classes of math before review *sweet !
* and so we went to jasper 's cafe ... .
anyways did n't like the teacher much ... .
i can now see what i missed last year hehehe for day two .
oh yeah we had to write `` goals . ''
whoa they invaded ethiopia ... .
it 'd be kinda cool being able to see the two alliance churches in london get together and just get to know one another and bring new christians to know god .
i 'm lazy today ... .
making a stop @ carmen 's to pick her up ...
practice piano if i have time .
oh yeah which reminds me ...
though i 'll miss it because of badminton conference ... .
preetty boring i know ...
but it 's hard acing a song when your left arrow does n't work .
we did n't really do anything ... ..
brunch .
he seemed to not understand we 're in grade 10 math and would make an equation look so hard .
i met up w/ thompson and jason .
yes ?
this time though he was on time ... ...
eventually when me and age decided to go on the `` t-bar hills '' ( which now has a chairlift so technically its the `` ex-t-bar '' hills according to daniel ) and me and age would end up going on the new chairlift hills .
-home : drummed ... .
i mean ... .
i think those two crews deserve to go to finals for 1st and 2nd .
it was pretty cool .
and then find the handout afterwards in my binder .
9 was way more exciting .
later .
so after the message ( which really whizzed by ) we ended with a closing prayer and then ... ..
not much else .
well in the end when i left ... .
drew pictures ... .
wish that we could all one day pay attention for once .
a really insane week @ school *programming project , bio project , first time tryin out senior band , and a math test* and for tonight ... ..
however , that remains to be proven and this reporter , for one , will not report the senseless chatter of blabbering midwives .
wow really boring today .
and then bible study class ... ...
great chances of it happening ?
convinced him to think about clones instead of off the shelves .
and i think this was all totally set up by the lord this year .
wow ... ... .
well after service came the final closing day of job .
i 'm gon na go sleep now .
it 's pretty funny though watching mr. clark seem to have this `` master '' plan .
but for now ... ..
it was n't bad .
3/7/04 just another average sunday today did n't have too many highlights .
also we balled a bit in the end ... .
wanted to go home but i felt better throughout the day .
exams ! ! !
hmm ... ... ..
wow today 's quad meet ... ..
yay the feeling of emtpiness in your stomach .
and then studied for math test .
basically she was n't havin ' exactly a great time growin ' in christ .
it 's friday so band ... .
children , the old , and of course the working age people .
it was time to go .
but then ... .
hmm what do i have to do today ... ... ..
doubt anyone would take one .
reliable memory !
actually ours is pretty funny .
*sigh* you wonder why 3/4 of my class is failing math .
g'nite .
plus now i 'm also gon na try out for london youth symphony .
well i 'm off to sleep now ... ... .
i think gavin woke up first because i awoke to him singing urllink milk and cereal .
i did n't really mind the fact nothing happened today ... .
then sc 'd , cs 'd , drummed and stuff for a bit and that 's basically it .
and of course just for other stuff ... ..
tlc joy ahahahhaha ... .
hehehe=p .
weird .
on things like `` how did we even think of doing worship this week ? ''
trudging into music ... ...
so like i said before ... ...
i 'll decide later =p .
that dream i told you about a while ago about my church growing ?
who knows maybe my mom naming me in the hopes i 'll be like the joseph from the bible has an effect to it =p .
now to programming .
civics ... .
learned about job .
so after the media , we went to our final interaction of the day *sigh .
jenn how can you possibly think it 's a good book ?
for me .
later .
then went home ...
*2 hours later* theory class .
well bell rang , but since football banquet was tonight i stayed there until 5 .
oh yeah ... .
ugh ... ..
then me and dan went back downstairs for a bit more cardio , then i had to go .
unlocked s2000 , got some new parts ... ...
crammed for bio w/ tehm , rachel and underhill .
we were perfectly in sync it seemed .
later .
so yeah band was pretty boring ... ..
after service we went downstairs like usual ... ..
ca n't wait = ) .
and some milk instead of tea for once .
i guess this is where prayer comes in , and just doing whatever is needed to improve your relatioship w/ god and secure yourself a place in heaven , which connie yesterday depicted it as a `` party '' where all your friends are invited ... .
well i still have another week to think about it so i do n't have to worry much .
and to after school .
had to go home early ... ..
oh well ... ..
lauren would tell me later at theory that it was apparently freezing rain and hail ...
* so quick ... ...
oh yeah and wendy seems to complain about a 51 '' widescreen tv being to small .
and i really do n't feel like doing anything at lunch , especially without food .
apparently there was no storm .
she was complaining about an 85 in theory .
chatted with ryan and milosz a bit , and then up i went to history class ... .
lol yeah i was wondering how embarrased mike felt .
ben got to cut that while i had to hold it ... .
the whole movie actually ... ..
* that really turned my stomach a little bit .
for some reason i did n't feel like sleeping , and decided to pull out my wow worship 2001 cd from my dusty cd rack ...
*sigh* tc 2004 , the chillin ' in downtown t-dot , yeah it 's all gon na be cherished for a while hehehe .
basically what happened was jason ... ... ..
most of my evening has been spent napping , and watching the leafs and sens game that ended with the leafs humiliating the senators 4-1 .
i may not be good w/ html ... ..
4/8/04 whoo !
hahahahaha !
they were @ bar 40 and i was on 139 ... .
but coool haha .
so yeah changes and benefits did come , but sometimes we are just too blind to see it .
it was time for 5th period .
it came when gavin and them came around 4 .
and then after a shweet nap , went to dave 's grandma 's house for dinner .
meh .
i was kinda tired too ... .
however ... .
today 's story : easter story ... .
i just hope april will pass by as quickly as march ... .
the rest of my day was also as usual as the other days , with another sub teacher since whart is gone ...
honestly be a bit generous you fresh shmucks .
and also ... ...
wee .
dinner met up with some people .
effective ?
ugh shoveling the stupid snow .
and into basketball gear lol .
i added the comment for them to try to use one plate so i do n't have to clean as much .
and i do n't regret going to stobie 's .
mr. clark decided that he 'd move band from wednesday to monday ... ... ...
lucky it was behind glass .
yeah that basically summarizes music .
so me and john are back on the doubles team .
if i do n't like it ... ... .
i do n't get why this school seems to think it 's perfectly fine for a student to take over 10 pages of notes in one morning .
the rest of my day went something like this : -history ( more research ) -civics ( more debating ...
not exactly best thing for 3 hours before praise night but it happened .
i really wan na do good in music .
very unique .
so today 's saturday was a really fun , exciting , and jumbled addition to the rest of my week .
that 's why .
by now i felt that i had no need to be angry anymore at the events of the morning , so i went about with my day , and i felt more relaxed and not as peeved as the day went by .
do n't know what happened with them .
s'all good though ... .
instead of waking up at 615 ... ... ...
me , jason , and dejan vs. dave and jacob .
i got ta wait for summer to come .
apparently she 's cc too i think and not rcm .
well in the end we met up after around an hour when scott had to leave .
this is why 15 year olds shouldnt play with feather birds .
but when you got a gimpy partner ... .
woke up around 8:20 , did my hair , ate then left .
and then drove down to jason 's to get him too ... .
my hectic easter holiday .
30 yard dropbacks , 50 yard passes , running when he figured out i ca n't run routes that well in a football game .
it 's sorta like how if you read something saying something like `` do n't program this program like the humans did . ''
later .
my biceps feel so numb still ... ...
but same thing =p .
so much steak ... .
it prevents you from doing stupid things and theoretically if all is done by the book and his word ... ..
wwii is a joke ...
jason was complaining about how cold his feet were , and one guy suggested he put plastic bags in his shoes .
then dad came home .
wth i thought i was done and over with that teacher 2nd period !
which i 'm pretty good at .
today took a bit of a turn though for good friday service ... .
short term memory .
* well according to jason 's blog *go to it it 's in link section of my site* miss .
wwii went by quickly .
day of ... ... ... ... ... ..
we had an all db team which kicked ass .
piano , drums , etc .
en ... .
today i literally did nothing .
but yah tonight 's meeting actually was pretty cool .
i heard actually from people who went last year it 's pretty fun .
i 'm doing the presentation for sunday , plus it 'll be my premier on trombone i think = ) .
but meh i 'm gon na be taking this course all the way till i graduate .
it 's 12:25 ... .
i even stood on the front doorsteps and did the ( cchk cchk ... ..
my old hype counselor somehow knows jenn lol .
this is when a good old hat comes in .
i hope i make it at least hehe .
then came dinner .
i seem so bored .
english class consisted of reading though so no biggie .
did n't really accomplish much .
cleared out the fridge .
well after a brief talk with jason ... .
*crack .
i kinda got used to the cold from walking home from bus stop .
then you start to confess your sins and ask for forgiveness .
actually it 's cool seein ' us all gettin ' more involved in church ... ..
tommy : yes .
guess just a reminder of what easter really means .
btw ... ... ..
where i would have a 50 minute appointment lol .
fun eh ? =p not .
and i do n't wan na fall asleep halfway through my midterms .
roast beef=p .
hahahaah j/k .
then came sunday school class .
not bad of a place ... .
we started off w/ some praise songs .
like i said we really needed to take in our direction senses in for a tune-up .
heh funny though ... ..
he 's one down to earth dude .
now , we try to remember words of faith to bring others to christ and gain spiritual gifts and prizes , and to fight off the temptations of satan . ''
i might consider going there more often ^_^ .
well looking back on my weekend : huntsville , hype sleepover , and now sunday ... ... .
nothing could ever top that ... ..
i was surprised how nice it was .
wow it was a pretty fun day though ... ..
go watch shrek 2 !
grabbed some more pizza from the new pizza hut and then ate and walked simultaneously to the ucc .
* after civics class ... .
if you did n't get that joke ... ..
tommy : no .
but it looked like absolute crap so no big titles .
trying to find the gym in a school seeming to be 4x the size of central .
1/8/04 e-z goin day ...
lol some fat monster looks like a sumo wrestler ...
the snare drummer ... .
er saw .
bleh the two worst combos that can happen .
this week has been one long week ... ..
really points out facts you 'd never realize ... .
with da new sub mr. mccumbern or sometin .
math .
did some h/w , played sc , read some blogs .
he 's actually a lot taller than me now .
though hyperstudio is an embarrasing program , dejan has a pretty sick `` the matrix '' slideshow .
i guess .
2nd year in a row lol .
now she ca n't have kids or go the the bathroom properly .
well eventually he 'd go clean it off , and he 'd get me back by hitting chalk brushes in front of me .
semi finals and finals .
i passed !
and just complaining in my head ... .
dinner and some h/w .
and now for math homework .
about pressing onward towards a goal ... ...
first act 's memorable acts were oriol 's band *where i realized that gavin can play the guitar better than rory ... ..
march break sometimes to me seems more exciting than summer i do n't know why .
tired ... ...
yes ... .
for song of response ... ..
eventually we went to auditorium to meet this kid kristopher who 's travelling across canada to raise money for organ and tissue donation .
like , jesus totally rose from the dead .
lings , drones , scourges , you name it lol .
=p .
he was the cch defense coach at one point .
it was a piece of land with a missle turret around every corner and other buildings to replace the ground that has no buildings .
sc then sleep !
cramming for history and overlookin ' trigonometry stuff .
too bad all the group seats are taken *blast* but we managed to find some aisle seats near one another .
bleh ... ..
and then came lunch .
just lots of jokes and stuff ... ...
did n't work =p .
who are the 2300 people that have hit my site ?
and i do n't have my sonatina that well conquered .
in fact with jason , mike and some other people already out in toronto , it really makes tc seem closer than it is .
that got my attention though ...
especially at pac mall seeing them lol .
so yeah not that great first impression=p .
later .
normally .
wow tc is inching closer and closer .
maybe because i now wake up at 6am for most of the mornings of the week , or maybe just because it 's the week after march break .
3/4/04 today marks 12 more days till tc hmm ... ..
now off to bio .
ugh torture .
hello flatscreen lcd .
only game not like it 's a project .
just got ta keep this sound going for 2 more weeks ... ... ... ..
and not become a 160 pound gr .
for some reason i 'm getting better at science .
and before i knew it it was lunch ...
funny though when mr. campell had to sub for ms. manson for a bit today .
after running through senior band , wind ensemble *senior one* stayed back for a quick run through .
yeah like i said not exactly an insanely hard game to beat .
hmm it 's kinda funny ... ...
this really is n't my happy day ... ...
whoo .
woulda started in december if it were n't for it .
well i played silent hill 3 for a bit .
but instead of e it 's vitamin supplements and instead of booze it 's juice .
*yawn* yeah i 'm gettin pretty tired now .
i was really surprised .
hmm ... ...
i basically lost my voice there ... .
i hope i can sorta link millz tonight , or get one handed rollbacks ... ..
yeah london 's pretty slow moving though .
got ta study for science test which i was doing .
josh was `` jolly jellyfish josh . ''
grr ... ..
made probably a 20 % fg % .
tv time !
nick 's glasses did n't even fit her but when she put em on it was funny .
weird .
so we all went upstairs for the last part of service where the communion happens .
well looking at my hair again in a mirror ... .
and just the environment around me ... .
so me and john ... .
but yeah these memories ... ... .
in fact i think we should make it almost like a church tradition ...
so boring .
apparently he 's catholic ... .
now this was when we heard about ada and matt 's most embarrasing moments , but the main highlight was basically sumair 's almost-as-long-as-a-testimonial speech about how he came to christ .
good should n't be in there =p .
the crappy kind .
so we played bf for a bit ...
ugh .
wow was it a workout .
hmm no one on msn at 11:30 *wonder why ...
jake is kinda on the crap side of drumming .
the breakers were decent .
and then headed back to school .
along with the other ensembles = ) .
and my church 's chinese ministry does tend to be less participating in events i guess than the english half .
hope they face off with tampa , since i really hate philly .
lmao have n't heard that one in ages .
i mean honestly , what could beat a day of worship @ church , class w/ brian , nfl street , wendy 's b-day , 50 pounds of meat and the nba all-star game ? !
i woke up @ around 1030 after a night of ... ... ... ... .
you know usual history class .
my day started around 730 once again , with me dragging myself outta bed reluctantly and then trudging down the steps from my 2nd floor to my 1st as i am anxious for my breakfast .
so yeah this blog will hopefully be decent length .
now since i 'm running low on time ... .
unfortunately i got dissed by drew today .
i 'm the lone blogger it seems now lol .
well now the bell 's rang by now ... .
i just hate hitting really low notes on t-bone .
but first my regular school day .
wow we all just started laughing .
so yeah from then on me and mitch had to counterbalance the bench lol .
so got there around 8:50 or so then ... ...
3/21/04 early blog ... .
i decided to relax and sleep until 1130 lol .
dan slept , there was some pool , and fooseball would be the centre of attention for much of the time lol .
take me for example .
biiig difference .
well ... ... .
got everything done and left the door at about 7:50 or so .
5/23/04 day 2 of may camp : thoughts and doubts day two of may camp i really felt god 's presence with us .
so had a quick breakfast , and then headed out the door for badminton .
i would then ask why would we end up sitting here and eat when we coulda had dim sum in toronto .
though there is much suffering and pain in this world ... .
went to jaspers , i think i scared eddie w/ my cheap imitation of him ... ..
9 fobs always take the couches ? !
ugh .
i learned a lot from this though .
* so i did n't really touch it .
chances are you 're either really stupid or you really deppreciate music .
i read scripture for it .
though it was a humiliating 11-3 loss ... ...
4/11/04 another sister of christ baptized : many congrats steph = ) hehe to think that 8 years ago we were all in sunday school learning songs like `` jesus loves me '' and winning food if we could memorize a bible verse .
so all math class did some review of sine and cosine laws , and chatted .
now we are in elimination round ... ...
but nope ... ... ...
well before anything else calvin and carmen are on a two-game losing streak for ushering .
today patrick 's mom and dad drove us to school .
i 'm running out of paper and plus i think i 'm gon na get carpal tunnel syndrome from all this note-taking =s .
like any other tuesday , wednesday or friday i woke up at 630am , trudged out of bed , and slowly made my way downstairs for breakfast .
so we spent most of the time rehearsing ...
i mean in the bible even it talks about it .
so right now pretty tired ...
though i was supposed to meet thompson there today at 8 ... ..
so far its paying off .
i mean , just imagine someone shoving something to pry open your jaw , then two strong forces pulling them apart so wide , that you hear the cracking and dislocating of your lower jaw and the joint part .
so got out of the house as fast as my can , as my dad also could n't really stand it so we were both working as a coalition to escape the grasp of my house and was on the road in no time .
and january was free membership month .
2nd game was hilarious .
i guess it just made me think today ... .
well it was more of a talk today than playing -me and nick saika tried helping some dude push a truck that was bokan ! .
the modem dude !
but yeah back to the hammond story .
sure like i 'd actually do that .
so i quickly took adrian 's bike and jetted my way down to her place lol .
had some sorta pasta that cost me 5 bucks .
oh yeah found a bbq lighter for some reason lying around in the chalet .
5/7/04 my 2nd pair of glasses : 2001-2004 yup ... .
lol that was just terrible .
in fact if i do n't play ball tomorrow , i may head there for a lunch ^_^ .
trigonometry !
oh yeah we had a ms. dymock for sub .
but yeah we studied until bout 6 ... .
ran .
anyways ... ..
what would i ever do without it ?
and quickly managed to finish up the project ... ..
same sorta storyline , except instead of one person fighting them all off it 's a group .
that was when i countered with my usual random rants ... .
so he 's playin ' either mixed or guys doubles now .
right now i 'm very tired ... ..
just watching the day drift by slowly ... .
i . )
what ?
aaaaaaaaaaaah ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
then walked home .
1/24/04 long day ... .
did n't really see much except for some younger kids that go to my church .
romeo and juliet=boring .
i have n't been using the odb actually for a bit , and i 'm actually gon na probably begin using the purpose driven life devo book for the next well ... ...
lol hilarious .
lol him and tyler look almost the same though ... .
though i did sorta wan na see cold mountain but dictatorship was not the descision-making tool in this situation unfortunately or i would have won .
nothing higher .
this would be one sad moment of the huntsville trip .
i really like how they portrayed satan in the movie .
*shudder .
i also pulled off a decent airchair and pikes , as you can see on my msn display pic .
well headed to usual science .
so yeah i 'm really gon na be asking for god 's guidance in this .
i 'm becoming one of those too lol .
the collision on the highway apparently did affect us .
where we 'd find steph and rebecca waiting for us in the theatre .
joe : maybe because i am chinese ?
well yeah that 's it for the night hehe .
*shrug* weird bunch of kids lol .
we went upstairs for food .
and i really was starting to really hate my frames .
lab , worksheet , lots of crap .
compy ... .
*sigh* and the most moving part now .
went over adjudication for stage band x and then baddy practice .
civics today : caught up on stuff i missed ... .
hehe .
huh ! ? ? @ ? @ ? ? ! ? ! ? ! ?
well hope i 'm right anyways haha ...
i 'll read 40 pages in 4 months .
and mitch showed me the monty python song `` i like chinese . ''
it was funny listening to him speak cantonese though .
and i 'm even falling asleep from writing this part of blog because civics can get really boring .
wonder why .
whoo hoo !
yeah apparently mrs. wharton was sick today so mr. clark merged the two classes together into one big class .
hahaha another presentation of the rules ... ..
they do n't have to worry about education funds , or the money put into health care .
but enough side tracking .
ok i guess ... .
yeah and now i 'm on msn , blogging , kazaa ( d/ling some new songs ) and probably gon na sleep soon .
=s .
overall yeah this film was very accurate ...
point is he 's courageous for a kid period .
i beat him =p .
anyways yeah ca n't wait till then..
but yeah rehearsal actually went really well today .
yes i have weird ways of remembering things .
fries with mental personalities ... ... ..
*shudder* oh well no session apparently .
i mean i do n't see why people like to throw it away .
thompson would eventually join me in a game of call of duty ... .
and now we are onto a project where we have to animate a whole animation thing .
gah !
already existent ideas and stereotypical thoughts =p .
so while mom went to buy stuff and grandma went to get her haircut , me and my dad walked around the mall looking at cell phones at random fob cellphones store .
there was still a lot of talk about basement jam .
go to basement jam 2005 if there is one that is .
or however you spell it .
she assured us it ai n't gon na be that crappy modern one w/ leonardo the craprio or however the hell you spell his name .

missionary work today .
blast habs lost to tampa 4-0 ... .
great timing by all today .
they do suck a lot though .
all grade 10 's .
but was april fools plotting a joke against me ?
and like usual maggie and becky and them had to suffer=p .
so pretty athletic sunday .
for now ... .
honestly for any average human your reaction would have been arrest him .
and it sucked .
mmmmm french toast ^_^ .
is n't very exciting .
it really gives me an uneasy feeling when i see them taking communion .
snow peas have become a fav food of mine now .
it 's over and done with now .
12 , but the graduating class ... ..
many think it 's funny how the excessive blood squirting is amusing *i did a bit ... ..
anyways enough of this , basically she pretty much made part of my night crash and burn ... .
was n't bad ... ...
now i 'm realizin ' that before when i complained about god not being there for me or sometin ' , really it 's just me being too ignorant to even stop and listen to anyone ... .
oh yeah just before the leaving for movie thing ... ...
i wo n't touch up much about it .
is probably bedmas .
but the pizza at jasper 's ai n't bad either .
was kinda interestin ' how somethin ' i learned at 11 came handy 13 hours later .
think i 'm gon na go drum for a bit .
talked a lot about school .
uhh ... ... ..
we were in the middle of cambridge .
still in 5th place .
half the class was at kiwanis , and the other half at fiddler on the roof .
told finlan to get a picture of mao tse- tung and he gets a picture of a chinese warlord who looks like he 's only 10 .
gon na go watch snl maybe .
later .
no work ... ...
whoo hoo ! ^_^ .
so much work to do today that i kinda shoved behind me from march break .
today joining us was vincent ...
indescribable haha .
i got addicted to bf 1942 and most of my time was spent playing that .
and before i knew it time was up .
i do n't get it at all ... ... ..
anyways when i got on the violet bus *finally* after putting away my luggage in storage bay , i quickly ran to around the back and claimed a seat .
also , i 'm hoping to make it to both days of tc instead of one .
the net looks blurry from the perimeter lol .
sometimes .
anyways yeah we did that for the whole time ... ..
for now i think rebecca st. james and chris tomlin are just fine .
boring , same as careers ... ..
`` mmm ...
and that stuff kinda carried through grade 9 .
learned about battle of the atlantic ( my comp froze , destroying my note ... .
and nearly falling out of my chair when sitting down to eat .
watching the movie .
random choosing of people to talk about their book .
called `` rain fall . ''
so now life is much easier , without the bothersomes of band , i can sleep in until 720am every morning now heeheehee !
so both ways i 'm having fun .
i mean i guess the person i helped on sunday has n't totally slipped my mind yet .
that was pathetic .
i especially am excited , as today marks the fact that there 's only ( yes count them ) 5 more days until senior tc 2004 .
still got senior band tomorrow hehe .
bused home w/ dejan and elaina .
anyways back to the optometrist now ... ...
great study = ) .
he did n't seem out of it at all .
can it ?
enough of that though ... ..
well now that i 've been awaken from my slumber ... .
actually they real cool people ...
after staying up till 1230 last night watching sportscentre and avalanche winning *and sens winning also ... ..
all of em haha .
so got there in record 5 minutes *no way* and back to house in another 10 ... ..
and like usual the music sucked .
originally i was gon na breakdance after school but no stereo > = ( .
me and jason struggle to get 1 in 3 games !
but it was pretty funny at the moment .
use your imagination to fill them in .
the channel that everyone over 40 seems to enjoy .
after workshop it was lunch ! ... ...
yup ... ... .
i guess this is just like a `` reflection/thoughts '' part i 'm adding in ... ..
ugh did horrible ... ..
and taught thompson how to refine his `` mm ho gao ngor '' a. k. a .
whoo !
not too exciting ... .
i have call display too .
so yeah ... .
we did scales major and minor , and since i already know all of them from top to bottom ... ..
and for anyone that does n't know me i hate bees .
would n't you like a reward if you went through a hard test like job ?
yeah it really sucks .
he went out to some rural town in bc , and preached to some first nations people .
quad meet !
more still for next tuesday ...
later .
snowpeas .
sucks .
hmm ... ...
the fact that all the songs no one knew , and low rehearsal time also added to this , making today like i said before not one to be remembered for effort .
i woke up at 550 !
after kicking the crap out of all the opposing teams in rec , it was time for interaction 2 .
* or sometin like that .
the beginning of 4 and a half days of freedom !
i only said one joke *hermann then smacks thompson ... .
`` woot . ''
talked for a bit..
as finally i have pretty much secured a spot for gr .
it 's also crazy how gavin felt it during worship ... .
too much to say .
and ddr extreme .
being in the same classrom 2 periods in a row is n't fun .
lol so far all i 've got is there 's a depressed woman that eats a lot and has started to talk to a woman that blurts out about her life story to random people .
and it should keep me entertained until starcraft two comes out .
i average 27 mins a day in gr .
my tongue still feels burned from it .
president , treasurer , and vice was pretty much default ...
holy crap it was a friggin ' monsoon here for most of the afternoon .
and i 'm now gon na head to sleep .
that was the highlight of band really ... ..
oh boy this is n't good .
may her spirit be with the god almighty now .
thought back into thursday on the way to huntsville , back from huntsville , what we coulda done to improve performance @ the school , what i should have done in huntsville spiritually , hype , etc etc .
but after this sermon ... ... .
but honestly how many of them i 'm wondering actually got a emotional punch from hearing it ?
by the way mr. richardson was our previous long term sub teacher .
but yeah before i sidetrack to the end of my day let 's cover the first part of the day ... ..
tired and still weary from yesterday 's 6 hour sleep ... ...
bio class started really slow for me as i was sleeping for first half .
well today was n't extremely exciting ... ...
happy belated birthday joy !
carrying a whole bunch of crap for school today .
after a three hour trip , and some very songs in the car ( gavin and dave were singing beer bottles on the wall ... .
mostly drumming .
ping pong will be remembered with the dumb twists we made to the game .
weird ... .
and gavin and josh i think were talking about their tc experience .
well today i almost thought that with the line `` do n't pray like the gentiles do . ''
coming up with titles like only this amount of time left until this happens !
i guess it 's good .
pig dissection was very amusing , though the preservatives did smell .
3-2 series only now !
also robert was being a retard trying to open the pig 's mouth and eyes ...
and we 'll ahve a different one next tuesday .
*wump* sleep ! .
so i 'm still stuck w/ same old same old .
i go home ... ..
so before i knew it , class started , i handed in my music critique thing , and got 12/10 on my music log = ) .
and quickly begun working on the church 's presentation for tomorrow .
our dollar sucks and gas prices make buses look more and more appealing each day .
oh yeah and math mark ... ... ..
anyways yeah , chatted w/ thompson mostly , since we kinda ditched the others when they wanted to go to some crap sub place for lunch , and yeah talked to monica a bit ... ..
4 pancakes is around 20 cents .
makes student body happier ?
so far my group wants to ally w/ 2 medium sized groups to kill the big group .
so yeah i actually got to intake some knowledge .
noooooooo my beloved time magazine bag !
smith tells us : `` dude !
piano went ok .
we made a lawn mower and washer and dryer lol .
*hack hack cough .
well slowly i motioned over to drums .
hence short blog yeah ...
yeah very average .
they 're old though so i do n't really care .
so far none of em have plummeted below 80. high of 91 ( history ) and low of 83 ( science ) .
i have got back into badminton .
no way !
so we kinda got into an argument *details not included* and then in the end i kinda ended with a `` alrite i 'll stop d/l music if either god or the artist tells me to stop . ''
now for lunch .
both ways i really did n't like it .
hmm dunno why but i was pretty cheery today ... .
then came announcements .
so i get to drop my first test which i got 73 % ...
i mean , i 've never had such a feeling of christ being in me to make me re-dedicate my life .
so for now ... .
and 2nd who the hell would wear a jersey of someone that is in rehab and sucks @ hockey ?
i have very complicated thoughts on this whole thing and it would take a whole day of blogging probably to lay it alll out into text .
really felt i had guidance from god .
i think not .
waaah !
no blog right now even comes close to matching my huntsville one .
not like i 'm gon na be using my parts anymore .
drank the remaining wine i opened the other day .
when we got back to school though ... ...
fresh fried rice ... ..
that was kinda amusing ... .
sadly it 's the last day of march break though ... ..
though it 's a drama , it 's a good one .
and i was amazed how fluent my prayer went .
but yeah interactions was pretty cool .
now we have a grand total of two ...
on my camera .
have n't had that for lunch in ages .
i actually noticed it !
i mostly meditated and prayed .
on a controller ?
after that we went upstairs to grab some stuff to eat ... .
we drop off grandma at her house *across the street , * chatted with my uncle for a bit who just pretty much put surround sound everywhere in his place , and then got home .
bought a new ps2 game , saw a movie , and figured out friendster ( www .
so now away from that flashback .
so yeah the one hour after school now ...
now it 's almost 130am lol .
it 's around 10:30 and i 'm home .
mike , connie , ali ... ... .
so yeah i 'm out for the night ... ... ..
also it keeps me occupied ... ..
jason would then put on rush hour 2 to watch while i studied also ... ..
see like i said i did n't do much today .
yes ... ..
330 ish ?
we also touched on the issues we have that were mentioned in emails , and will try to work them out throughout the year .
5/27/04 yet another short post yeah another short post kids .
me and gavin will own the team competition =p .
well this morning was wednesday so another day of waking up really friggin ' early .
nooooooo way !
so starting my day wakin ' up at 730am , i quickly ate , did usual morning stuff and then headed to church , all ready and such for sunday morning worship practice .
melody 's not the only person with a 90+ now ... ..
then i sat on comp for a bit , talked on msn ... .
nathan as you can see is killing thompson in this season 's throwing each other into the snow competition .
and here i am now , an hour later @ 1225am ... .
well like i mentioned already ... .
well now we are kinda even .
obviously the flame went out from suffication .
umm so after the study ...
but there 's some food for thought on what i think a lot about ... ..
i was first again ... .
oh well ...
waste of time ...
like usual .
well i ca n't relaly slack off i 've come to realize .
found out we got a seminar and exam this month .
yeah is n't it trustworthy=p .
and then dan and me pulled an airchair or two .
phone=gayness to the max .
so here it goes ... .
it reads : `` but you will receive power when the holy spirit comes on you ; and you will be my witnesses in jerusalem , and in all judea and samaria , and to the ends of the earth . ''
and some other stuff too lol .
i break out my d-cam and start taking random pics and vids .
nachos !
also , i have to play on the 26th @ centennial with the rest of the senior band .
programming ... ... .
something in the back caught my eye .
so me and him sorta thought `` who the hell 's that guy ?
exhausted now ... ...
i came home , but that never really got outta my mind since my mom was talkin ' about it with me on the way back home .
surprisingly though i see adrian ... .
session sucked ... .
that sums it up basically .
boring .
emergency theory class .
funny but cool also .
a lot of talking , excitement , etc .
4/19/04 yay !
maybe my mark will go up even .
so after that short assembly , headed back to class to vote .
almost forgot there .
i talked to brescia at lunch a lot , since i went over and sat with her for most of lunch .
but yeah we watched a video for the whole time today .
not much else really happened , since a lot of people in that class was on vacation .
*cringes at that thought .
yeah mr. curphey 's response : `` tell your parents that when i call them saying you 're failing . ''
amazingly no one complained .
well anyways yeah most of this post is gon na be about basement jam ... .
*shrug .
then off to science .
at least we are missing class ... ... ...
blogged .
we have to compare the provincial and federal parties and see the differences .
yeah i sat around waiting for 30 minutes ... ..
argh 40 minutes left of school !
i ca n't believe that it 's already saturday , the saturday that marks 4 more days until tc 2004 for seniors .
2/12/04 final descision : ca n't go to semi .
lindsay however was another storry lol .
so i 'm cool for now .
calvin then came , and we all ate then jetted for basement jam .
circle strafe , mash keyboard to dodge bullets , etc .
and did usual crap ... .
last year i got beaten out since my partner seems to struggle at figuring out how to hold a badminton raquet .
i pretty much won lol .
i 'm blogging as fast as i can today because i still got ta practice my cheese piano , so bear with this lame blog .
jason would eventually head off to play sc ... ..
yeah nothing exciting ever happens in history or civics , especially on band days .
obviously the running had the best time but crabwalk and walk had about the same amount of time .
but argh so many interruptions !
so we ended up getting an extra 30 mins for inconvenience , which would drag into 45 mins ... ...
made 1/3 jumps great sucess rate .
hmm ... .
amazing !
but i just hope that they were christian and that christ will look after them in heaven now .
i 'm one of the sole survivors of bloggers .
but without further delay ... .
triangles scare me .
lol hilarious song though ... .
i looked like an idiot .
but yeah i 'm lucky i posted so it saved all of the stuff up until the holy crap .
and i saved the replay .
lol the car ride there was sorta amusing hehe .
so we got photos taken , the assembly was pretty lame ...
slept through most of 2nd half of day .
5/22/04,5/23/04,5/24/04 typing up my may 24 weekend ...
hahaha .
muahahahahaha !
i say lung since if he waas in stomach ... ... .
i got a london youth symphony audition on thursday ... .
* lunch : went to subway ... ... ... ..
drummed for a bit ...
i remember when jason wrote the entry about his classes when we were away on huntsville and how they were all barren .
many responses were the movie was powerful , and it really showed how much jesus suffered for us just for us to have eternal salvation .
it works though .
obey your thirst '' hehe .
but i would n't sleep as when i got home ... ..
it does n't mean they are mean ruthless people .
* well i still did it obviously ... ...
argh also got ta practice niki 's and kelsey 's accompaniments ...
holy crap the stuff i 've missed .
now unfortunately we did n't make use of our ttc day pass much , and ended up circling around downtown toronto not knowing where we were headed lol .
i 'm going to try to look around everyday for how god 's done something for me each day in my blog ... .
yup ...
how stupid for the government to be buying stupid programs like that lol .
j/k that actually is it .
it 's kinda cool but at the same time very hard .
if it 's even on sale .
but i wo n't reveal anymore .
original six .
i think god really was guiding me when i asked for guidance throughout this exam .
like john 3:16 or the lord 's prayer .
i liked the class before more when we watched the video on the battle of britain .
least i lost knowing i lost to the 1st seeded team in the league ... .
i have to work on everything basically !
gavin : oow ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ..
no one really came to tonight 's movie night @ lcac .
lots of laughs and crazy stuff happening .
oh well , quickly ate , had some fun with the camera , and then headed for our first and final bible study for may camp ...
later .
so that 's one `` goal . ''
yeah not very exciting except for the mitchell falling off the chair .
that just means it 'll only be another year until me and gavin are tc captains .
oh yeah travis is kinda close too .
good recovery from huntsville .
oh yeah !
*shrug* maybe next time i do this i 'll do it earlier in the year lol .
he read from acts chapter 1 , and the memory verse for this week i find pretty cool .
so yeah i would be late going to jason 's house to pick him up ... .
but i need new pics for breaking , and also i need to get windmills .
* turns out he is coming *good* and he was gon na be at my house any minute .
like sleep or sc = ) .
see today we had a workshop on `` descision making '' and how the four main things that affect it are : values virtues variables vision so yeah ... ..
worked out and balled .
sub teachers are pretty lame .
envisioned sorta i guess my english congregation being a bustling service .
it was pretty bad ... .
heh saw steve zhao from the team come today too .
wow ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
amazing !
it 's english .
and then off to bio .
mmmm .
me/calvin and mike and the other guy got eliminated round 1 .
but it was over .
poof !
somewhat ... ..
hawaiian pizza ... ...
is gon na be in my memory for a long time .
maybe a new job field : biochemical psychiatric medical accountant of law .
cool , we 're playing something somewhat famous .
ok see that part of the day was pure crap ... .
pretty unique though .
his arms were n't exactly well ... ..
er ... ... .
however , after christ rose , they would die , and even be crucified just to stand up for christ .
did n't miss jack ... .
calvin/joe vs ... ... ... ... ... .
lots of breaking .
what 's next ?
read it and umm ... ...
now i go to dragon court to pick up dinner .
i 'm out the door !
now the exam 's on the week that wosaa 's on .
then back to studying .
and then after i got everything on ... ... .
meh i 'll blog after i guess .
oxford was gridlocked from talbot intersection all the way to wonderland intersection .
perfect !
i kinda forgot my booklet though and just asked for emails lol .
so yeah history was kinda interesting today i guess .
crappiest song ever ... .
well we ended up going to burger king .
somehow accidentally i pulled off 3 or 4 hops of dark hammers ... ..
nothing really big happening .
so forcing myself out of bed ... .
end of grade 10 ... .
oh yeah that 's the other thing ...
well w/e it is anyways lol .
see there was this one line about sadness ... .
possible =p lol today i kinda got in touch with my acting side ... .
and really cooked up a good meal today for everyone .
woke up around 8:30 today ... ... .
and of course church in the morning ...
so yeah my feet were cold .
everyone still remembered how me and calvin got burned by futonics .
it 's pretty sad =p .
we found a customer : sam zhang .
and the bus driver started talking to me .
well after that i got off my bus ...
and finally i see gold !
wow great combo .
first thing pastor dale asked us was what we think is a `` right '' form of anger .
and did that for a bit .
i 'm gon na try typing this blog up a bit quickly , as by the minute i 'm missing the colorado vs. dallas game for playoffs .
i 'm not bout to become the next mozart .
but it was pretty funny .
well since both of us had cells ... ..
james naismith ?
so i had to glue together the two he gave me .
2/3/04 meh ... ..
yes !
seventimes .
well he seemed to think it was alright at least .
i felt like jamming badminton birds down his throat ... .
so it 's basically the same thing , different letters .
spencer and igor were gon na session but nooo not anymore .
but for me ... ..
so going to school , i guess i was in a good mood ...
i think .
lol very new .
later .
d'oh !
really busy .
the respone song i felt today was really suitable , being the song `` sanctuary '' which goes like this : lord prepare me to be a sanctuary pure and holy tried and true with thanksgiving i 'll be a living sanctuary for you there are a few more verses , but that one 's my favourite .
i 'll sit in front of it for 3 hours straight reading it whole .
after realizing this is the most pathetic idea , we decided to call his cell .
josh was somewhat frusturated feeling like the only leader , and carmen did n't seem to be havin ' that cool of day .
i was relieved it was friday though and dad drove locally around london on fridays , and that it 's pretty much guaranteed he could n't have been involved .
of course though i 'm gon na keep on pushin ' on the goals i 've set for myself at tc .
me and jessica would still be bugging him about it .
it kinda ticks me off sometimes .
at first i thought i was in the wrong place .
good job dudes and dudettes !
well today was n't that excited ... ... .
nowhere !
anyways yeah .
basic as in my usual blog *hee hee hee .
yeah weird valentine 's day huh ?
was crazy .
so boring .
feel sorry for patrick .
showed us the interview w/ mel gibson about his new film passions .
my eyes would be burnt by now .
today mainly we talked about the movie that we all just saw last night * the passion of the christ if you do n't know what i mean .
but yeah jason 's house actually is pretty cool place .
vena cava , aorta , pulmonary vein , etc .
the morning was a blank .
was about basketball , and writing books .
class today we listened to the len nation 's story of his life .
when you have dilated eyes .
well i got there around 6:50 ish .
yeah today and yesterday have compiled of nap , nap , and more nap .
and me and john had to prepare to whoop finlan and hughes ' asses .
`` shut up . ''

oh well yeah anyways i hope he went home and wo n't be stranded somewhere like eoa .
yet a blur at the same time .
basically for two hours ... .
so yeah and also ... .
so far i 've been having a good year academically .
since i 'm a bass line , i basically follow tuba , or in other words christian *music genius* and sam zhang *asian retard .
bio class : had kevin luzak 's sister come in and talk to us about organ transplanting .
from then until 730 basically i slept ... .
after a awhile though mr. pigeon came though and supervised .
somehow managing to be 2nd highest mark in class lol .
lots of people needed help lol .
that was communism day ... .
well originally i was gon na go session today @ ucc but then decided not to because i was really lazy .
well ... ..
food was bad but most chatting in whole time .
well ...
i know you must think i 'm insane to think rules are amusing , but just the way they intro 'd each rule was hilarious , with ways like : -2 fast 2 furious ( do n't be late ) -the matrix pills ( no drugs ) -freaky friday attempt to jolt ( no changing teams ) -tampon commercial ( for name tags lol hard to explain ) but yeah this year 's i have to say was a lot funnier than last year 's lotr one .
all of a sudden i get the tv remote .
school seems to have plummeted since grade 9 ... .
first we ate this cake stuff called `` tiramisu ...
holy crap this is actually challenging !
compared to yesterday 's sneezing , coughing , aching and etc. , today actually was n't that bad sick wise .
today at hype meeting i 'd find out that kendrick ... .
coffeehouse 2005 !
ju pah for dinner ... .
but worship was still good ... .
12 's as possible to semi , i felt that i should n't buy a ticket .
i kinda do n't know why they made this thing this year ... .
now i would n't know what these would do until after i looked in a mirror ... ...
then the rest of the people in the world are either poor christians , other religion people and of course atheists .
oh yeah starbucks opened too today according to natalie ... .
actually it 's stopped looking out my window but it was raining .
oh yeah and today robert showed the full might of his stupidity : katherine : hey robert ... ..
i was happy with a 70 lol .
10 and senior band all in one week ... .
trance , dance , etc .
senior band is a lot more exciting than intermediate ... .
bummer .
to think that only a month and a half ago i was complaining about exams .
`` yes ? ''
was featuring an american woman .
originally rebecca and josh were gon na help too but pastor mackness said 3 was enough .
history *ugh .
after dinner ... ..

i ca n't really get past one lol .
threw around the football then played some ps2 .
so he dropped me off first , and the food , and then drove back to ah jau to pick up his car and park his truck .
josh then also came out , and he also was surprised they were gone .
honestly , school days suck for a gr .
too many of them lol .
saw mike n ' dan .
today 's practice seemed different though .
yes the teacher i 'm supposed to have is finally back .
even if not that , she 's the first hyper to be testifying before baptism hehe .
looked at `` media spin '' afterwards .
so yeah hermann kinda just did something i was supposed to do a long time ago ...
ugh it breaks in a matter of 2 months anyways ... .
afterwards met up with thompson and them and we went to athlete 's world for a bit before heading back to school .
got home and first thing on agenda : type out hype report .
oops=p .
oh well but it looks nice i guess .
sour gummy bears and gumballs .
i handed in the assignment due for the other day and then began working on today 's work .
you have to be there , or see the video .
i 'll decide ... ...
well ... ..
leing lui over there ah !
props to whoever came up with `` late start day . ''
argh .
liked the message today .
why ?
and so far it 's been doing good for me =p .
it was actually pretty interesting what he had to say though ...
one day , one day , one day only !
he walks better than finlan already though .
it actually took me almost two hours to be able to find everything .
ugh monday ... ...
golf .
but to think ... ... .
seriously , it looks like a drip of ketchup compared to british , japanese , german , or chinese history .
well that will kinda be a breeze .
oh well ... ..
after about 8 rounds of that his crew member throws him a water bottle and he does another 5-8 rounds of millz .
originally i vaguely knew g or c lol .
there 's gon na be three really exciting blogs ... ...
* music today we crammed together the two classes and rehearsed .
* stupid bar chords ... .
and eventually yes they did come .
and then after that mom finally arrived and drove us home .
so i ran for the cherryhill .
ugh stupid cell phone ... .
they even sent the game into ot and managed to lose ... ...
wow james bond techno w/ our play lol .
and igor , mike , dan , jonny , and anton were there .
i thought it was a pretty cool gesture .
maybe not ... .
oh well ... .
that was probably the more interesting part of dissecting today .
sessioning is now on like # 1 priority 2morrow ...
and richard gere is too ... ..
but when i passed their high school i had the weirdest sense of deja vu .
dad came through again for being the master chef he is ... ..
well who cares enough of that time to go to jason 's ... ..
when i think about it though ... .
and off to senior band i go ... ..
the monitor says wow ... ...
only about 3/4 of band was there .
we kinda just roamed around the mall for a bit .
to me it was saying about how there has to be something else in this world other than our average life , and that someone *god* is out there watching over us .
i remember things that i do n't want to remember even .
arjun woulda done really well i thought ... .
showered ... .
* anyways ... .
being against abortion is easy ...
central had to stay for one last class .
but i was surprised there was something lower than applied lol .
* by the time i was done talkin ' to 'em , it was 9pm , and we had to go .
and well yeah i looked on bright side here too .
so dead tired after that ... .
being the lazy one that i am ...
i wan na get a ryde or sims board .
later .
blasted high a flat is still hard to hit .
yup ... .
took me bout 10 minutes to get ready and then off to pick up jason .
i finally get home around 1pm or so .
that place was actually pretty good .
ha .
only got a few questions left =p .
american posing ... ... ...
i mean i was somewhat frusturated running on overdrive at 2am last night trying to make everything right , and then in the afternoon today running home again to reformat it ... ..
zellers of course is a cheap store , so in the end they did n't have it .
bused home ... ..
which are really pointless and lame .
for many reasons .
so first to that ... .
well now we had an intermission before we went onto semi and finals .
debates were kinda fun though ... .
if i could anyways .
wow would school be super-boring .
and practiced some songs for music night .
kinda good that it 's sometimes a last class waker-upper for me with all the stuff that goes on ...
but ... .
gon na eat sometin , read up devos ... ..
as so rumours say a carb meal is good before sports .
but basically today we had a test , and i think i did ok on it .
the anticipated part of my day/blog ... .
cya .
yup ...
nothin ' much else happened today ... .
however ... .
more snow .
i was really bored tonight and did n't feel like doing any work , so now i 'm really behind in piano theory and practicing=p .
plus some girl that i do n't remember that somehow remembers me from pearson .
fob pic everyone !
thankfully it was a false alarm lol , but yeah it was pretty scary at the moment=p .
argh ... .
oh yeah , i started to read the book `` left behind '' in this class .
music seems to come pretty easy especially though .
lcd screen , speakers , photo printer , adidas shell toes ... ... .
now i 'm gon na sleep ... ..
and relieved from math midterm today was another day of stupid band .
oh yeah meaghan stuck to her wednesday track suit thing ... .
he decided to bring money to buy eggs at a non-existent supermarket we were supposed to stop at lol .
i sit by nick saika , maggie , mike , kyla i think is the other girl 's name , and sorta by thompson still .
read act iii ... ..
english i do n't know what i have and music i do n't have to worry about .
trying a hefty bit of brand new songs , no typical `` forever '' or `` now that you 're near . ''
most of the reason probably was from me in shorts , sandals and shirt in 5 degree weather .
well anyways after that i went home , finished some h/w , then to theory .
so yeah that was basically the whole music class ... ..
whoo .
got some h/w and did it ... ..
it really was a work of art ... .
and our class is sometimes so friggin ' retarded you ca n't get any work done anyways .
the first place cash prize was 130 and 2nd was 50 .
argh !
it 's just the fact that *quoted from jason* `` she plays so unpredictably i ca n't keep up with her ! ''
in one game i was playing against all hackers which pissed me off , and john and age , so i started hacking as much as i could .
he 's got ta know someone .
he also really showed me how powerful one 's love for god is , as he was the one that bought the church drum set .
we would get out some theme words like justice , love , mercy , and a few others which i seem to have difficulty remembering right now ... ..
but after interactions with our teams , and some rec games and then final worship ... ..
better than mcdizzle 's or bk at least .
read .
the sheets double sided .
but yeah first period was really boring , but at least the semester change is indicating ... ... .
got ta do a crapload of bio crap still ... ... ... ..
really added an affect to the movie i think .
lazy .
we were supposed to session for a bit ... .
oh yeah and the gavin josh thing : *on phone* gavin : joe make sure you wait for us .
weird combo i know but it works .
it was damn good though .
but honestly i thought he has spiritual potential ... ..
scrambling around for my things and gettin dressed and all ... ...
and now i 'm home .
the food ... ..
wee we scammed bk today !
mr. kilik and victor joined us also .
5/13/04 senior music night : wow .
and mrs. wharton approved my solo piece for year end assignment .
think it was chau chow or w/e , i did n't have much of it .
shweet !
i do n't even care about them .
then she started ringing the bellringer bell ... ... ...
when they turned the cross about face .
workshops !
but yeah ... ..
and to think now , 8 years later , in 2004 , i 'm sitting in the pews today listening to one of my fellow hype members stephanie chan , giving her testimony and anointed with the holy water , representing her full affirmation of accept jesus christ .
and i then just woke up , ate somethin ' quickly , did usual routine and played my piece only twice .
anyways after we left eb we finally got back silvercity ... .
but this will do for now =p .
that 's what the greeting was for in my subtitle .
why ca n't the world just revolve around y=mx+b ?
his dad explained later that he did n't eat until 745 ... .
saw some presentations .
but yeah apparently the speaker speaks even faster than me *it is possible* and we finished 20 minutes early .
apparently he 's supervising our test .
kinda funny how first 3 people i see are anton , jonny and tyler .
lunch today : good old galleria .
so yeah there was a traffic jam around cambridge , and we sat around for a bit .
great movie ... .
and wan na sleep .
but in the end i decided to sit at the table w/ thompson , mitchell , brian wong and some other people .
in a week and a half we are already done the war lol .
probably too many ... ..
* i 've seen it 3 times already in two days ... .
what a great thing to hear only 3 hours before 5th period .
* well in the midst of the explosion you get something out of it ... ..
i did n't mind it ...
and i go home =p .
but i would really like to see more church unity between the two congregations .
class lesson today ... ... ..
anyways ... ..
one of my hype counselors apparently went to the same church as jenn , peggy , and others .
well at least we got rehearsing done ... .
but i think it 's a dvd buyer for sure .
but kinda got foiled when my dude died hitting the ground .
eek !
yay lunch !
waited around for dad and then me and jason got driven to church .
seriously wth ! ?
well actually all but one below 5 points lol .
so yeah this march break was pretty awesome .
i guess if you were in that spot you 'd think that too .
but then again i would n't like force him to go to church or anything .
anyways yeah that 's basically my day ... .
no badminton ... ..
well w/ exams coming up and stuff , i guess it is n't really exactly relaxing .
anyways yeah we had class ... .
so i 'll let her tell it =p .
service was good ...
and then theory class .
do n't know his name yet , but he 's missing two front teeth it looked like .
look 's pretty good actually ... .
whoo hoo .
i think he could have won .
cya .
lol .
lates .
today was assembly day !
ran straight to drums .
and lo and behold i , joe chan ... ..
but reading purpose driven life is so much easier on bus .
wow big change .
it was ally 's b-day *happy b-day ally !
i can barely remember what happened in 2002 and what in 2003 .
got home around 5ish , and from then till now it 's been unpacking , msn , blogging , and dinner .
but not obliterate .
so read shmuck !
but i 've seen her around school once or twice .
besides its kinda cold going outside everyday for lunch .
as though it was n't long enough ...
well i guess i was thinkin ' at the time maybe it was time to go to sleep .
at first i thought they were pictures ... ...
talked about marriage cuz we started romeo and juliet .
hmm ... ...
hmm ... ... ...
so until tomorrow where i may not blog ( tc 2004 ! ) ... ...
after all that work ... .
but yeah the bus ride for the first two hours was pretty fun ... .
oh yeah , i had science before the forum ... ..
it was boring .
the trombones get to do do that `` gliss '' thing .
thompson had shitty pancakes from international soups today , and nate and mike had bk and subway .
it gets pretty boring walking home ... .
then i also had an all d-lineman team which jason finished the game with .
mr. curphey 's back !
so i improvised w/ comp and some sc .
today i had to go to gavin 's for planning for praise .
whoo !
i think i 'll stick with my tea drinking here ... ... ... ...
well he believed that this was a sign from god .
9ish ?
anyways me and gavin butchered that and began to singing single notes from tunes *like 007 theme* and did that so much we just eventually started getting tired from laughing mor than playing ping-pong lol .
literally .
you know the famous `` i have a dream '' one .
nice style .
morning went by quick since all i had to bring to school was a cell phone and my wallet .
but we do get to go on a field trip = ) .
this week has been fun *not just because i missed lots of school* but also because i got to see so many new things ... ..
in ways .
do n't wan na lose rollback forearm or my crickets .
4/16/04 busy today ...
give up your tickets to people who may never see some friends ever again at a dance after this semi .
summer mode .
the instrument is just a tool to help .
sleep !
and looked around the kiwanis program for events that people i know are playing at .
wait till i 'm a froshie i guess hehe .
after the anthem they seem to say something ... ...
our first interaction !
especially when things are n't going my way .
i got kiwanis confirmation papers .
to summarize my early day .
his movie was ingenious ... ..
math class we had some old hag teach us .
i really liked mine..
muahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha !
after this meeting *which was good ... ..
yeah it was pretty funny =p .
i do n't know ... ...
which went pretty good , and then offering .
was cracking up through the whole thing .
and yeah ... ..
* so afterwards ... .
and then also ... .
hammond 's or mall .
some stuff i did n't get at all though ... ...
the rest was awesome =p .
lalalala ... ..
i hate turing ... .
i am now sitting on my comp typing up blog and practicing my trombone .
it exists .
boler actually is n't bad now with new chairlift .
well anyways it 's around 1130 now ... ... .
then after the video though ... ..
biology !
i did n't know so when i began walking and then heads turned ... .
feta cheese on salad is actually a great combo .
learned a few new things and also figured out that planning means more than two days .
both of them were mine .
went to a place i have n't been to in ... ... ..
not very amusing .
apparently last class they watched the nuremburg trials ... .
and basically just moped around the house .
usual repetoire ... .
he 's pretty good at piano ... ..
saw gimpy there also .
later .
gavin : really ! ?
but yeah we chased him back to school with crap attempts ... ..
but the kia is n't bad at all .
what a change in location and times lol .
like the one about how she used to always wonder why teens seem to not understand the concept of sex w/ only your marriage partner and after marriage ... ...
i hate tiebreaking games .
maybe i can also practice mills ...
my old crt probably emitted more radiation than the nuke in hiroshima .
it was only 1030 so i got a breakfast .
and yeah lunch was pretty much that , just our group gettin tighter w/ each other and also meetin ' some new people outside of my group =p .
yes i realize that that was stupid .
do n't know why ... ..
my day 's schedule got pushed back a bit today as instead of waking up at target time of 9am ... .
i 'm not surprised .
greasy food .
maybe i 'll ditch my finance business job plans and head for a job in bio engineering ... .
so yeah my history mark is gon na be good .
but that will come in time ... ..
and of course mike 's unforgettable announcement time always after service : `` hello everyone and welcome to lcac .
sta 1 .
`` i want to have a party '' `` what kind of party ? ''
well i decided to stay there for a bit afterwards though since lindsay and her posse kinda invaded my room lol .
oh yah our response gavin kinda changed strumming patterns 30 seconds into the song , which made me basically wait until the chorus before i started playing .
thanks for the eye-opener god .
lol lindsay got a sunburn in 14 degree weather from reading hahaha so i 'm not that bad off =p .
all i remember is some lab testing acceleration ... ..
hmm ... ... .
came a very boring civics class to follow along with it .
but should i ?
shrek 2 was awesome !
lol u in suck .
and my mark is still at a healthy 87^_^ .
capitalist ?
we did an `` outstanding '' performance as described by kiwanis .
mitch literally killed me at that event .
the next 30 minutes consist of eating , eating , and more eating .
i really felt pumped for the lesson *yeah i know it sounds weird but it 's true lol .
still trying to work on windmill .
`` geez learn a better strum pattern '' `` play something out of g '' `` you know guitar 's have more music variety than that '' `` you know what your strum pattern is ?
ghettofob .
the sawdust was just another factor to make things worse .
well after eating ...
lol jokes .
undefeated in 6 games .
guess i have to wait till next week .
then i started blogging here .
then after the pmsed mr. mccumber , crap commercial , and crap playing ... .
o0o0o0o0o .
and yes this is why i have to pray .
oh yeah and saw mrs. wharton .
memories of the chair lol .
that killed around two hours ... .
kinda surprising .
i just watched basically since my muscles were kinda tired out from weights .
wwii history can be somewhat boring ... .
i would n't have had to lug my stupid compy to church for a 2 meg file .
so basically today we merged classes , and just had some fun w/ music before march break .
in the end he only lost 11-7 ...
today 's test seemed to be fairly easy ... .
and soon the guitar i 'm hoping = ) .
for a day .
breakfast was good .
5/15/04 hype : yes back to its usual fellowship =p before anything else ...
so today instead of school i awoke at 8:15 to get ready for kiwanis this morning .
kinda funny but i think i 'm the last hyper to see ali before she 's leavin ' .
classes were shortened , so by 1025 we were out and down in the auditorium for the student council elections ... .
so after that ... ..
hilarious ) -typing up bio portfolio -sleep !
@ home ... ...
and if your wondering if i 'm a cook nut or sometin ... ..
so then a frustrated group of ninety some odd centrallers packed their gear ... .
this sentence i think kinda cornered me as god would show me at fellowship .
i really just felt so open for it though .
so i 'm definitely going to go see movie night next monday =p .
yeah the main highlight was the icy vs. pokan n ' hermann warz .
well anyways ... ..
wow finally the long waited week of rest has come !
and one of my wishes came true ...
i 'll make this short .
and sarah wild , our goalie kinda just you know ... ..
too many to count ...
then theory class .
lots of water came out lol .
well until the next whitehills bus came lol .
anyways ... ..
hmm ... .
talk about ironic huh =p .
jason and alex and hughes and probably hammond gon na be bringin ' out the champagne and booze when gimpy moves out .
so typical lol .
especially when you are being taught civics , the most pointless class ever .
we started leadership unit today .
only 4 months of school left .
yup ... ..
lol .
when really it was a waste of b-24 liberator bombers , and well-trained american pilots ...
but it happens i guess *shrug .
steph spilled some tea ... ..
friday !
and for me a time of silence is a good time to pray .
now i do n't really care for either team , just that i 'd rather see sens in the playoffs this year going further than the leafs ... ..
4 hours of pure senior music .
and got a new piece = ) .
wow look at that emotion ... ..
we did what a church should do i believe ... ..
turns out i was just on time =p .
especially style !
back to the story ... .
good old kiwanis festival : joe 's best friend to avoid history and civics tomorrow = ) .
after the praise part of service ... .
after eating i went onto comp , checked msn , and then decided to go to sleep when i then thought i 'd call up jason josh adrian and gavin for some sc .
* the session lasted around an hour and a half .
heh have n't done that in ages ... .
sleeping .
also bump was fun ... .
after using the example of jesus getting mad at the merchants selling stuff in front of the church *as the church is a place of worship ... .
enough pondering about the future ... ..
then lunch *ding ding* well today jason came out for lunch with us ... .
great message .
i may not even have to go out for lunch anymore =p .
for his presentation he 'd sound like this : `` nicotine *sniff* is a form of depre*sniff*ssant .
it 's pretty obvious who wins in our races .
today was the day gavin actually discovered london has no subway , though he 's been livin ' in the hicktown for over 10 years : gavin : this is my first time on a subway ...
i 'll help with a few things though .
now unfortunately after kendrick sorta gave me a bible to read since he thought i forgot mine *really it 's because i pay attention better without any distractions* so i started flipping through the bible that was-to-be dan 's .
well after the rehearsal it was time for history .
well after watching the sens being humiliated in their final game 7 , and the 3rd or 4th year losing to the leafs , yeah i 'm grateful at least my favourite team ... ..
and so after that talk ... ..
bio class : worked on our digestive system theme park .
speaking out of me word for word .
not very exciting .
mmmm ... .
* basically this is what 's comin ' up : april 10th : easter study april 17th : praise night april 24th : farewells and year end party ^_^ those are the last 3 meetings ali and jt will be in unfortunately though ... ..
so when we came out i was surprised it was only 8 o'clock or so .
but when it comes to winter ... ...
so tonight i 'll try to make this one another average joe blog ... .
meh w/e ... ..
day 1 of march break .
sure .
she also reported that she and friend mary `` mother of james '' smith encountered an angel at the tomb .
so i get to ucc 40 minutes later ... ..
also saw tori *have n't seen her since gr.9* and of course the ucc people .
after dinner though ... ..
she 's coming back after march break .
least i do n't have glacoma or anything =p .
after the lesson chatted around for a bit ... ..
basically me and hammond snuck back into the dinner since were n't supposed to leave *oops =p* and then we all left for some free time .
but i really agree with it lol .
sadly i was kinda falling asleep from lack of sleep last night ... .
4mb vid card ... ..
not much to say today ...
so until tomorrow ...
exam plus toronto tomorrow hehe .
really good .
did some things ... .
* and plus he 's also a bit more retarded lol .
wow i wish that was back up and running .
huh ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ?
lol it 's kinda funny cuz we can kinda go milling about in the room and he ca n't do much about it .
i now know why parents say we should cherish our childhood .
and i 'm surprised that i still find the will to blog at 11:45 at night .
and to think i had time to gel my hair , pack my bags , and eat french toast ?
ms. manson was yelling like usual about our loudness .
we did n't really play today ... ... .
i mean it 's not the fact i hate finlan ... ...
i 'm gon na get carpal tunnel syndrome probably soon from all this writing .
poor dude .
so we ended up playing some ps2 , ddr mostly , and then chatted for a bit .
use zing .
i just felt so spiritually cleansed right at that moment , with all those sins i had been shoving in the back of my mind just washed away .
we played electric fence ( had to get someone across these two ropes in between the ropes ) and also this thing where we had to all of us make a certain `` machine '' out of all the kids in our group .
just got to school in time for bio .
headed to school like usual ... ..
now normally i do n't complain about my ears freezing ... .
poor kiddo lol .
that one where it has all the little parts .
it was kinda crappy to see that sight though ... .
unfortunately both the drivers died ... ..
normally right now i 'd do a jot note blog , but nope not today ... .
and my feet hurt also heh .
well the last few moments of our huntsville trip ... ... .
i think i woulda bombed .
wait scrap that hell no i 'll just prefer it over a burger ... ...
lol i used to get at least 60 % during summer ... ... .
so yeah i 'm kinda trying to get around homework , piano theory , piano practice , and attempting to identify the keys on the keyboard while typing .
i just hope that josh knows where he 's goin ... ..
yeah that and also we kinda discussed about a few other things .
*sigh* a teacher is using the `` scientific method '' to teach the class about evolution ...
hmm ... .
me and hailey could n't really figure out this one person 's name in our group .
but i beat him at 21 2/3 times .
a day that will be in my mind for a loong time .
of course afterwards worship practice also ... .
like even gavin took almost a year ... .
i did n't know about history test until today .
or back in grade 5 or 6 when i played the piano for children 's sunday school 's christmas performance replying to ali 's call for a pianist .
also i ca n't stop thinkin ' about how tc went for the juniors .
that was like you got served except cuban style .
muahahahahaha something i can piss off the twins w/ when they piss me off = ) .
3/18/04 tc 2004 : re-dedication in my life ...
and we honoured the junior boys volleyball team who won wosaa , and x- country and girls senior bball team ... .
i 've never really liked 106.9 .
well i complain about post-holiday sleep syndrome .
and at the moment colorado is winning 2-0 .
so of course i woke up .
lol i do n't mean to sound cocky but i do n't know how i managed to be undefeated at central 's first badminton quad meet today .
i finally get dressed into badminton gear ... ..
props man ... .
but he 's laughing still lol .
lucky kid .
gavin : is there one in london ?
apparently her theory is she 's only there for 5 minutes so she can leave .
for the afternoon i drummed whatever i could , then got ready for worship practice ... .
i now remember why i do n't blog until my whole day has passed hehe .
it was a good run through of the songs , and pretty funny when dave rutt was conducting w/ his trombone haha .
some houses in his area are huge .
arjun and i are both going to be playing against each other tomorrow at kiwanis .
and then home .
forgot how to do a few things though .
i was thinkin ' ... .
got ta make notes for english essay for tomorrow ... ..
oh well , it would all be forgotten *well not exactly but no one talked about it* after we saw finding nemo , which i have to admit was a well done movie for disney .
hopefully i do n't screw up tomorrow .
i bused home while jason walked .
that was hysterical .
it was a typical morning .
just my right eye is being more and more blind .
* well after that , since my dad was in the bathroom , i decided to go on msn .
stupid clocks ... ... .
i mean , one thing i always wanted to do was meet someone from wlac , and that got done this may camp with our co-ordinators from that church .
i then announced my piece .
mmmm ... ... .
anyways we basically just went over weather test we are having on thursday ... ... ...
my romeo and juliet book=p .
lol .
actually originally my plan was to sleep until 9 and practice but screw that i thought , which i now regret .
and have time to relax and just quiet time w/ god ... .
well i dunno what happened to him lol .
reaction when the dude picked out the name : host : and the first battlin ' crews will be chosen from this random hat of randomness ... ...
-woke up for stupid band -ate -got a ride to school for stupid band -went to stupid band -then came music class -mr. mccumber was having lots of moodswings today -science ... .
fried rice ... ... .
like instead of singing through 16 songs in 40 minutes ... ..
it was off to careers .
how many weeks have gone by in my life ?
downtown athlete 's world is n't even that much better than masonville 's .
50 minutes of talking aboutwhat i wan na do with my life .
the usual .
ugh i still need to work on my shot .
sadly we do n't have mrs. wharton once again as she has to go into surgery to repair a hernia or somethin , so we are stuck yet with another sub teacher .
so yeah we chatted bout that for a long time ... .
well in the end i kinda do n't remember the teams but my team won w/ boughton being our star runningback , kick returner , kicker and center lol .
i might buy the game .
you my # 1 rice nigga . ''
you wan na see it ?
and the 3rd time watching it today was no different .
`` oh why ? ''
but others were pretty funny .
i would arrive at school pretty early ... .
i was stuffed afterwards .
there were a few of us @ session today .
boring .
* and then josh decided to wear steph 's pink scarf today .
so we just played random songs ... ..
just readin qo-ran for more knowledge .
service today ...
=p .
in the end i think there were 10 of us from central .
aww nuts it 's raining !
we played godzilla eats las vegas as opposed to the last 7 weeks where we practiced vesuvius and our challenge pieces for kiwanis .
i remember paul did that w/ patrick i think back in grade 6 , which is anton 's maturity level now =p .

and no time to lose ... ..
and then after that ... ..
and that concludes another day of dreaded gr .
time really flies .
tomorrow i got band plus a assembly to `` guide '' me through my course choices .
plus it prepares me for the future when i have to order dim sum on my own *omg what a lame excuse but valid =p .
got really bored .
well i did n't really accomplish much .
maybe i interpreted it wrong though , because i was half asleep for most of it ... ...
so after lunch ... ..
math : review .
smart idea bombing a legal drug factory .
* come on guys doubles !
i mean though mr. mccumber did calm down these last two weeks compared to before but i just do n't like him .
but then decided to flop back into bed .
and footwork was unbelievable .
age got killed 15 miutes into the game and jason would end up limping his lone engineer bay to josh 's .
got intermediate band still tomorrow .
and it 's funny how biased mr. dayus is lol .
n e who , announcements came on ... .

same for may ... ..
well ... ... ... ... .
so yeah right now ... .
social justice conference ... ..

makes me kinda want to get karaoke revolution lol .
yeah basically it was hilarious *ask others that saw it totally indescribable just plain hilarious* and we find out ... ..
got rebutted pretty effectively *shudder .
announcements today : badminton season has sorta officially begun !
i just hope we sound good .
i started off waking up at 8am ...
so plus me and my mom donating the total $ $ $ made : $ 40 ! ! ! !
got ta sleep early for baddy conference tomorrow .
up until now i still do n't get what 's with me and thinkin ' rainy days are gloomy ... .
ugh why does time have to seem to fly faster ?
got nagged at for forgetting theory .
band , history , civics , math , and then programming .
thought it was expensive back then .
whoo hoo ! .
who cares if kiwanis turned out pretty crummy this year ... .
but i do n't really care .
me and arjun think the 2nd place shmuckette shoulda been disqualified though , since she played a piece that was n't even supposed to be allowed in the program .
it all started with another cheesy burn by me ... .
final worship ... .
3 people trying to hold out on a spit of land meant for only one person .
wow does it sound good now lol .
i think that grain products though like noodles and pizza ... .
josh said no and that a sin is a sin .
at least i 'm starting to adapt to senior band more .
yay !
well originally hammond and steve were w/ us too ... .
and yet 4 trombones still produce more sound =p .
smart kid eh ?
you got guts to be usin ' that gift .
ate some stuff , and then headed out for the movie ...
only bout 15 more hours ... .
also when you do n't know what to add for a sound effect ... ... ..
first thing though when we got there ... .
he had to just go through so much toil , and arguments at times to get to his goal .
and i love livin ' every minute of it ... .
she basically told me about how her life 's not exactly too cool at the moment and how @ tc she never really felt that comfortable .
* well after finally finishing our food *mom still did n't finish her burger* we finally got back on the road .
history class was ok today ... ..
nothing much , so i wo n't touch on it too much .
including god .
you know ... ...
yeah game just ended and i 'm typin this blog at 10:45 so *shrug .
sounds famliar ... .
black track suit for me .
i barely know em lol .
pretty easy day for me ... ...
so catch you people later .
i threw my bag into alan 's cavalier *shudder* and then the ride back home .
whee late start day tomorrow .
5/9/04 happy mother 's day !
and it was a pillow fight frenzy for bout five minutes before our fight was stopped by mr. baldwin lol .
burger king .
i also have enough burdens right now with school ... .
so this one 's gon na be a late comer .
we have now officially decided to add a worship part to our hype meetings also .
he 's got ta know someone .
rain , worms , and work ... ..
6 hours !
today i could actually make out the melody in shark bait , and our below mediocre drummer jake actually completed a fill correctly !
who cares though we need one of those every once in a while =p .
i feel special =p .
but i get it now .
school .
amazingly though i whoooped graphite ass on this test .
some other group ?
he came down around 830 or so , just in time for the start of breakfast .
well we started off the study session with a game of nfsu , then some nfl street ... ..
studyin ' for bio then i 'm out .
ugh pray for me people ... .
so yeah today we went to galleria to eat ... ...
but not quite because i still have food=p .
yeah they left .
plus huntsville o..
but yeah i could n't believe how many 9ers are going to semi this year too .
did the amazing dive shot i 've been dreaming of since grade 4 .
well after that went downstairs to chat for a bit ...
i 'm really startin ' to sometimes really be able to just picture the exact happenings of the stuff written in the good book .
then we left .
phht ... ... ... .
but that 's ok ... ... .
and then drummed for an hour , then ate , and then ... ...
but loud .
ehehehehe=d .
he was pretty funny though .
food .
apparently senior band made the kiwanis `` stars of the festival '' concert for vesuvius .
wow ... ...
uhh ...
science .
that was why i really liked it also .
it 's just in my opinion why i did n't , and i do n't expect it to even be applied to anyone .
with the energy surrounding us and just the great worship section they put together , wow that woke me up for the next two hours hehe .
until later ... ..
yup ... ..
did some lab w/ people running ... .
hehe prayers for my history test and math test to go well ... .
so basically i boarded for the whole 8 hours we were there .
i woke up at 7am this morning .
it actually passed by real well .
when other people make donations to the school , it always goes to music program , i mean we are one of the best schools in london .
it was my `` big '' entry into the theory class ... ..
yay !
could n't find jason or gerty though .
must sleep !
really disturbed me in a way .
eventually none of us would play and i went to ucc since i thought stefan and them would be there sessioning .
mmmmm food .
skool again ! ?
well ate it ... ...
it 's time to talk about my day =p .
stopped by adrian 's house to see if he was still coming over .
our info pile was 3x bigger than anyone else 's too .
only difference i really noticed between senior band and intermediate band : senior band moves faster , but looks at stuff much more detailed .
him and adrian both got sim city 4 ... ..
goin ' to sleep soon .
solos in a week or something =s .
the assembly today was on multiculturalism .
cheeseburger special .
or maybe how to use dreamweaver in a productive fashion hehe .
ehehehehe today has n't been the best for memory bank huh =p .
the other guy pulled off mad top rock and footwork .
talked ...
`` image is nothing ...
we ended up battling first .
think i 'm gon na be thinkin ' twice before i type now .
and then yay !
ehehehe ... ... .
jokes , good times , and just gettin ' closer with my bro 's n sis ' in christ .
but yeah we had a pretty good meeting , went over many issues/hopes for the future of hype .
then after that ... ... .
which means i did n't go canvassing tonight .
with pirates of the caribbean , nemo , some other movie about bears , and all those stupid `` exclusive '' dvd 's that no one would even give a crap about .
i have suceeded !
anyways back home now ... .
but depression era sucks .
wth ! ?
well since it was raining i thought `` ugh i 'll do kidney canvassing tomorrow . ''
plus playing it for 3 hours is kinda lame sometimes .
wow it really was weird .
which was really lame of mr. curphey to do .
was n't best rehearsal in the world ... ... .
saliva+hcl+water=almost solid solution .
i was gon na say weird but earlier when i was talkin ' to my dad he used the word `` powerful , '' which i find much more appropriate .
we also got our untouchables reviews back .
wow the people that presented today for bio class ... ... .
hmm ... .
as usual talked for a bit , but today rev .
lol .
i even gave it away at the beginning .
mcd 's for today .
and i 'm still studying .
which was n't for a while .
goodbye 7 year old radiation crt ... ..
anyways enough of saying who else blogs , if you wan na see that go to my site and click on the links .
but even the younger people seem to be too `` busy '' with other things .
hmm ...
played a wee bit of ball .
then it spoke of many analogies about how we should stick together to make life easier for one another .
connect to people and chat .
i mean she could at least try , and have us laugh at her lame attempt , like mr. estabrooks last year , or mr. douglas .
yeah me and arjun managed to get through the whole song !
do n't ask =p .
only reason why i 'd even go see it is because of breakdancing ... .
bused home w/ john ... .
we learned about the depression 30 's still .
patrick was waiting outside on my driveway again in his van .
more snow .
mr. clark then gave us a pep talk for kiwanis ... ...
er in two years .
11 and 12 ... .
but it really made me reflect on my christian walk .
i then met up with steve and eddie and walked to my stop .
kinda reminded me of hype back in the old days .
ugh i played horrifically tonight , but point is the band still sounded good ...
but somehow they managed a silver still ... ..
basically calling the two blondes/ditzes ... .
new songs ... ...
we headed out for kiwanis then .
i have fob spoilers now .
oh well ... ..
class consisted of finishing up book of jonah .
so i then packed up and headed upstairs for bio ... ... .
yeah ... .
but listening to the artists like 50 and chingy ... ..
we somehow got really bored , seeing this movie over 10 times , and we started replacing a word 's first syllable with the first syllable of `` shmuck . ''
if not everyone 's .
almost forgot lol ... .
8 exam next january .
-stage band x : new song ... ...
then he left ... .
gavin shot back in the end though ... ...
had to work on project and stuff ... ...
`` hold on '' *not tnt mix tommy original* is so good .
maybe i 've been influenced by the joseph in the bible ...
but i 'm not about to explain how i think god guides us .
i mean i pre planned for the week , chilled with age , went to church , and of course ... ... .
if his seeing the spiritual realm gift is true ... ...
the one about my church thriving just from people evangelizing and had nothing to do w/ church image ?
well we had an open circle , but in the end it turned out to be ... .
well ...
later .
why ?
so yeah i can actually sometimes compete against some university students lol .
it is still a house of god ) -we should go to church to worship god , but with human nature we sometimes stray away and start to think of how a building looks instead of worshipping god .
was n't exactly rock , or ska , but it was like spanishy music .
well yeah that wraps up my 3 days over the may two-four weekend ... .
it was good though .
i really thought our response song `` pure and holy passion '' fit in real well , basically with the lyrics saying that you want god to be your leader , and we may see him and go on after him , following in his holy and true footsteps ...
but yeah the dreams i had last night stayed in my head for only about two hours lol .
made one mad play with returning smashing ... ...
11 student came in to play for us ... .
heh lucky we 've had 3 sub teachers .
sorta lol .
and bad luck for them too ...
the twins , carmen , rebecca and calvin are headed for the junior one on monday and tuesday .
boooooooring ... ... ... ...
so yeah got ta keep myself in shape now ...
after not using one for over a year ... ...
and hendrick won !
i know its ounds kinda mean but after rebecca made that brulee ... .
i 'm almost late ... ..
but oh well no worries ... ..
* and then just did some stuff with it .
so after doing a crapload of that ... .
but it 's worth it for senior band i think sometimes .
i mean it as in just the detail , the images and the power that this movie really has .
happy mother 's day to everyone !
we did n't do much .
yes ! ! ! !
= ) plus i know how to play a f chord now ... .
well after all that stuff it was lunch .
but steph tonight was just lashin ' out the burns lol .
congrats he just sat on the lid for the pie .
so yeah just a bit of a heads up for me even i guess ... ..
but i ca n't even surf the internet at times with so much crap going on in the class .
took us right there ^_^ .
got some stuff still to do tonight , plus band tomorrow , plus i 'm still half sick .
i think i got ta organize better .
well ... .
still had to do some stuff @ home and i was really tired .
but this is when intense schoolage happens .
net .
well thursday kinda does n't count because it 's only a 10 minute music exam .
not many places to practice since the cars in the garage .
for now .
started paper 10 , and did a lot in the other ones .
me , nick , mike , and maggie traded around glasses to see how we looked .
lol jason was complaining we had been there for such a long time ... ..
no worries though .
and some other sunday christians *aka christians who do n't really believe therefore not being saved* and those now go to church and are more devoted seeing what has happened .
it actually still looks like brass and not like plastic .
after tiring gaming ... .
overall i thought 2003 was n't that bad of a year , even though there was sars , blackout 2003 , mad cow disease ... ... .
so i only had 15 mins to get ready .
well now i 'm off to rant about music class ... ..
being delayed and omitted by nfl street .
fake quiz on first day ...
wow this is gon na be one slow year .
josh said that after i was saying how paying that much money for a may camp seems expensive , but when i think about it now , it is n't .
i ca n't wait ...
* we are up to the part where friar lawrence plans to fake juliet 's death .
basically we all talked about tc from different pov 's ( points of view ) .
well my mom went to ucc , and me and josh played some sc w/ jason , and i played some ddr .
1st day 2 back from exams basically today i got a lot of crap back .
gah !
got home around 6:30 ... ... .
then i could have longer break .
i was early for once and made it to patricks house *breathes* without him coming to my house to pick me up because i 'm `` late . ''
lol jason 's not the most amazing qb but the stuff he did was pretty funny .
i mean i can figure this crap out just from process of elimination .
too bad he could n't stay for graduation lunch today .
later .
i dunno who but lots of people .
blood pressure measuring is funny and i felt my heartbeat .
the flim .
sad how hollywood needs some sort of `` america 's got hope '' thing in the movie .
personally if i were in his stage of a christian i would n't even have the courage to pray in public .
aaahhhh whew ... ..
so if today 's blog is kinda short it 's because my eyes are closing on me as i speak ...
eew .
really cool thing to do i thought .
well anyways he was on my comp , looking up stuff on the net , and we 'd eventually be doing this for about 20 minutes or so before my dad finally finished watching the tv .
and then a guys doubles game where it was me and thompson vs. my uncle and some other dude .
in my group alone there were like ...
if any other maafaah kids read this ... ...
ca n't wait .
a few questions ringing in my head earlier today ... .
i did good in school .
two new school computers , or maybe ... ... .
i was really bored .
yeah she thought it was ... ... .
really wished that i could have made it for the whole thing but yeah still it 's all good .
and then went into groups for prayer .
mmm ... ..
we said our final good-byes and stuff , and headed out the door for our final subway ride down to union station for home .
or aka aid in keeping us crazy hype kids below `` insanely hyper . ''
in another round which we won ... ..
and very weird .
2/4/04 course selection day drawing near ... .
and got some h/w .
dave was talking about his dad 's army stories like this one where this guy had to be trained to give himself needles , except when he stabbed it into his thigh he stabbed it the wrong way and ended up piercing his thumb .
war , peace , combining villages , anything .
as it is such a lame course .
apparently we had to cite everything and not just quotes ... .
`` ghetto gangstas '' for sure ...
just not well .
richmond court never fails =p .
where umm a guest person was doing praise worship .
well anyways i ended up playing for an hour and 5 minutes , then ate some pizza *nutritious breakfast eh ? , * jason then called me and i told him to come over at 1 , and then headed for piano lessons .
high standards from a grade 5 ... ...
at home there 's tv ... .
one of the guidance councellors came in and talked about how basically the descisions we make this year affect us a lot .
well sometimes in programming there 's something exciting .
yeah weird bunch of people ... .
so useless .
the 54 ton rock guarding the carven tomb was rolled away .
dunno what it is in english .
this week also brought many other things into my life for me to see .
ooooooooh yes ...
kinda funny how people used to have tomes and volumes of books telling them every tan , cos , and sin calculation for every angle .
the last one they made is probably a sound we never want to hear again .
gets so boring after 3 weeks ... .
now the 3rd one .
so friggin tired these last few days .
apparently all she wanted to do was give me these drops to relax my eye muscles .
lol later .
yup ... ...
we talked about a lot of stuff .
maisie 's with ... .
but we were victorious happy to know we owned finlan in both games= ) .
he was actually like in depth with most of the conversation with us which i was surprised .
and one seemed to be anorexic lol .
i do n't know if it was because of the movie , or because he 's really moving on his christian life ... .
to me honestly , prayer is probably like the biggest thing .
i wrote about how prohibition created a new job field ... .
like honestly who cares what guns were on a british battleship ?
confusing like usual because i hate physics , and also more note taking .
this morning i would too .
i thought it was a good cause .
he 'd come afterwards but yeah ... ..
power rangers was so cool !
hmm ... ...
but anyways .
i ate pancakes .
i 've been so tired last few days ... .
but after playing some nsfu on ps2 , me and jason then quickly ate somethin ' , grabbed two cokes and then headed out to carmen 's place for hype .
pretty cool when i think about it ... .
we took monty python and the holy grail and all the guys basically ran into boughton 's room and watched it lol .
but when i walk outside and the sun reflects ... ... .
whoo !
today i found out i ended with a 92 % on my careers project ... .
jason ?
so after about one hour of listening to music , well what else do people do going to toronto ?
and japs whooped their butts .
kinda tiring though .
and also was funny to watch dan get soaked by carmen 's water tap .
and then afterwards , yup steph was n't b/sing when she said last night no trombone today .
oh yeah there were some funny parts .
*shrug .
besides `` right thurr . ''
augh !
while that happened we somehow dragged joseph ma into it too and josh .
i really do n't care .
i think mrs. mitsis told her to find me ... .
yup ... ..
why did i have to not wear a coat and dress like it 's july in 5 degree weather yesterday ?
lilian was set for the exam too , and so when the bell rang ... ...
i slept through some of it ... ...
if hitler never pmsed though and started bombing london instead of the defenses though on britain ... ..
and a cold dinner since i had to reshovel ... ...
well yeah the bus ride home ... ...
and for project working today : we organized who 's doing what then everyone left .
so we chatted for a bit before heading into sanctuary .
i think i need social help .
well after the test ... ..
was n't a bad thing ... .
9 student body *the one i was in* only had 250 kids lol .
nothing amusing really .
praise , word that means confession that starts with an a , forgot what r is ( something like thanks giving ) and thanks .
worked on gambolier ... .
after all the work yesterday of cramming a whole bio project in one night ... .
sc ?
he 's a really weird teacher at times .
bye .
it 's like that old school game scorched earth , but with better graphics and you can actually see the difference between a tank and a walking doo hicky thing .
so weird lol .
* but yeah good times ... ... ..
sc ! ! ! ! !
i feel sometimes when god is around , the conversations that i have with my fellow bro 's and sisters in christ ... .
lol .
yesterday 's game was pretty exciting .
lol i still remember that moment .
it 's actually good too .
i decided i 'd challenge hammond in a game of rock paper scissors extreme *the one w/ the slapping on the hand if you lose .
i mean it 's an easy subject but basketball ?
and then ... ...
for overbite ?
had some wedges and coffee .
the rest of my day =p .
or my project woulda been smooshed going up the flights of stairs just to reach 3rd floor .
* the message today : modeling the christian life . ''
but i 'm not gon na talk about that .
i just said i wonder if she even knew what the word `` rookie '' meant that was written across her jacket =p .
after they were done i called mom to come pick me and josh up , and take gloria home .
before i knew it i was already at my stop .
so did tha from 2-6 .
go team martha aaah !
very moving .
dissection day !
yes !
anyways yeah that 's basically what happened ...
boring .
shout out to all tcers and ... ..
i still got piano *shudder* sunday : church , do n't know what else after then ... .
yeah i know it 's high but normally i can whoop those things to 100 .
today i headed out to galleria and bought subway ... ..
mostly all we did today was listen to our performance on thursday ... ...
i do n't get why since report cards are coming out in 3 days , but my teachers are bombarding me with so much crap ... .
martha 's in the top 9 teams whooo !
afterwards we then started talking about actual real dance tunes n stuff ... ..
i mean i do n't mind some ( like nas and such ) ... ..
anyways without further blabbing about that here 's a basic summary of my day .
genetics is the biggest joke in biology .
there was probably somewhere around 100 people in there .
make 's intermediate band look so crappy .
hacking is really gay .
found out eddie used to run ... .
oh yeah ... .
i have no clue ...
but the assembly really did blow .
i was beginning to feel light-headed from all the singing , and also just the fact most of us were going retarted in the van also got us pretty light headed .
scripture was phillipians 2 19-30 by the way .
built 750 buildings .
and the person she went out for lunch with ... ... ..
lucky i can kinda receive em hehe .
hope me and mophead can do the same for doubles = ) .
i just wanted to say gavin man ... .
brought my mark up from a 72 .
keep growin ' in christ jesse ... ..
no rep test ! ?
but yeah it is upsetting how everyone had so much hope *i mean even i had thought they 'd have a chance of finding her* but after today ...
muahahahahahahahahahhahaha !
we discussed a lot about the accuracy of the film also .
did n't give patrick a lift today since he said he did n't need one because he 's leavin ' later .
so yeah i do n't really remember 2nd half that well =p .
it 's free !
yeah i also recognized the person workin ' the shift .
as at times i may get pissed off quickly ... ...
well i think at least lol .
blah blah .
he actually came up with a very good point : with the $ $ $ usa spends on their 11 carrier battle groups ( consisting usually of a aircraft carrier , 2 cruisers , 3 destroyers , and two subs , plus various other frigates and minesweepers ) , if they did n't spend it all on those 11 carrier battle groups , they could have probably solved their poverty issues by now .
i 'm apparently liberal .
all those thoughts just jumped out of my head and off i went to study for english exam .
not that i do n't have to wake up then , but i might have afternoon classes =p .
so after spending time at the eaton centre ... ..
the avalanche made it in .
lucky it was n't band night or i woulda been screwed =p .
it was time ... ... .
i think it 's a pretty meaningful song .
your image on this world to others is nothing ... .
what a immense combo .
idiot .
perfect timing !
starting with usual awakening at 8 for church and not coming home till 1130 ... ...
me sleeping , mr. curphey lecturing , taking down worthless notes i will probably never use since i find ecology a waste of time .
but in 3 days ... ... ..
but hey who cares at least i tried =p .
jason absolutely hates them and lina loves em haha .
then some theory ... ...
awesome movie if you people have never seen it .
for me ... .
not .
well while we were waiting ... ..
i 'm too lazy to blog !
hermann then came with monica and co .
tides have turned .
leftover pizza ... .
lol it turns to be as exciting as golf after a while .
shooting= ?
not anymore '' joke .
it 's getting better i guess , but i think i should start playing more at lunch again ... ..
lots of thinking though .
for wednesday and thursday ... ..
oh yeah i really liked da brief history they made in that movie too ... ... ..
and managed to wake up on time for once ( 6:20am or so ) .
especially for intermediate boarders , since we for some reason had no lesson but we were n't complaining lol .
anton got adidas superstars .
average amounts .
just got ta remember to sleep earlier on friday nights .
so yeah , but for the first three days of march break , i 'll still be in london .
yeah the minds of various gr .
2nd semester is n't bright at all .
well anyways i got not much else to say .
the rice would make steamed rice , baked rice , fried rice , it 'd even make good matress filling =p .
it rings though hehe .
and a car .
but jangaroo ?
and also listened to the newly formed grace fm 105.9 .
our school against some maroon-coloured school .
some nsfu *finally progressed somewhere after 4 months* and jason read my brood war strategy guide for more strategies to use on battle .
i scored a 60 % on the `` how hong kong are you ? ''
gavin : that 's brilliant !
that never happened though as by the time i got home it was almost 4 , so i played some games until 5 , and then got ready to go to masonville for shrek 2 .
* well with my `` intelligence '' and hammond 's true stupidity ...
everyone just turns to jesse and laughs *jesse slowly hides behind church bulletin .
off to english .
with the `` hi joe ... ... ... ... .
spendin $ 500 bucks doing that and then killin ' yourself in the process ?
at least he can walk more than 10 centimetres without complaining about being gimped =p .
was kinda surprising though since only 3 weeks ago he was over at my place ... .
gr .
frederick : *hears saxophones* hey ... .
real boring .
and those 5a stick 's seemed to weigh a ton .
and thanks .
and of course went to jason 's house to study history w/ hammond and him ... ..
about to sleep hehehehe .
wow ... ...
then i said sometin about how by 2010 every white dude will be outnumbered by asians 3:1 .
1/9/04 week 1 of school over ... .
so yes ... ..
apparently god is called many different things throughout the bible ... .
studied d-day .
anyways those are the people i remember voting for .
he 's famous i know but i forgot his name .
*shudder* she 's loud ... .
something a drifting driver needs ...
family guy tonight was a repeat .
got yelled at to do better by kiwanis basically lol .
it was 11:50pm ... ..
and was written by none other ...
in fact after the sermon and pastor bartha called for the people who wanted to either re-dedicate or dedicate their lives for the first time for christ to go up to the front ( altar calls ) , i went up .
3/31/04 another month gone by ... .
but back to my day .
i mean i 've pictured it ... .
came home , ate lots of food , sc , drummed , showered , ate more , did h/w , , played trombone , played nfsu , watched tv , ate , played piano , blogged , fixed blog site , read stuff , twidled thumbs , looked around , drank milk , stared at comp screen and typed on msn , yawned , and now i 'm gon na sleep .
feel bad for ada though matt kinda just yanked it out of the bag lol ... .
whee *there gertrude i spelled it whee* we started watching `` remember the titans ! ''
we had another two sub teachers for civics ...
hmm ... .
cya .
after catching some shut eye , i finally woke up around 830 or so and quickly ran around the house getting ready for church .
and i was just getting settled into the no school life .
*ooook i think i 'm late* was my reaction lol .
so exciting !
craaaazy ... ... ..
it was also my first time helpin ' out someone in a spiritual `` depression . ''
whoo .
i would n't recommend it .
the aroma of bbq sauce dripping into the fire , the sizzling of the steak being bbq 'd and all ... .
i mean back in grade 7 , 8 , and even 9 everyday after school ... ..
for the dreaded science exam ... .
history i 'm not worried ... ...
like i still remember the one back when i was 8 that scared the hell out of me when i saw pupiless-eyed pale people stepping out of my tv .
which i have n't had in ages .
was n't bad at all .
this play 's gon na be stuck in my head forever .
i reluctantly ... .
she did n't really get it still , and said that both of us were wrong and how there was no problem of her taking up two lanes .
wow just to think she used to go to my church 10 years ago lol .
and yes it was an interesting music class .
but overall i mean the atmosphere is very welcoming and i can see why non-christians would be so convinced to turn to christ after going to tc .
lasagna .
he 's damn courageous for a 14 year old .
but today 's class actually was n't that bad .
lunch today went out with nate , fulmer , duong , chris and pourier .
lol .
i thought i 'd have time to add more later ... ..
well throughout the studying we had some pretty dumb jokes , and also jason pointed out that cirrus clouds looked like the flying nimbus *maggie if you 're reading this you can see that i 'm not the only person that uses cartoons to remember clouds lol* from dragon ball z .
a quick lunch = ) .
* thinks it 's so great hiding behind may ... ... .
now to worry about english *grr* ... ... .
some of his jokes were pretty funny from before i remembered .
nfl street was never better .
especially to everyday christians .
my group ultimately failed miserably and improvised with reciting the thing basically with other team members poorly acting it out lol .
so now i got ta go again on monday when it 's open .
the main thing though about the morning sermon ... .
mr. mccumber is n't the greatest teacher compared to mrs. wharton .
lol jenn seemed to have some competition w/ `` joe i convinced gerty to use friendster you lose ! ''
least it 's a good start to my `` season '' of snowboarding this year .
and june ... ..
just me , marcello , daniel , and then scott sidhu came too .
jason then came and his friend `` sauron '' came again .
well pre-meeting to plan out rest of april .
then i thought might as well try nfl street though it looked stupid .
it 's their last year .
it took me forever to trudge out of bed ... .
oh yeah and the fact that our governor general spent 1 million dollars of our taxpayer money for a 3 week vacation in europe .
lol ... .
i sat there for 15 minutes .
only a matter of 2 days before i have to sit in a room for my science exam .
mom woke me up when we arrived ... .
i switched back to golf shirt and jeans .
fun day though ... .
finally out of frickin school ... .
l dun dun dun !
he also talked about runners too ... ..
but as we rallied , and then got into our game face ... ..
we did n't really do much ... .
i took a shot @ graffiti-ing w/ photoshop .
band was actually not that long today ... ..
but we both realized we need more strum patterns for guitar .
and how it is said that a third of the world 's land mass would be lost once the poles melt .
think i said a few words too many like `` today 's sermon i liked ... .
but the fugue sounded good .
me , gavin and carmen got put together into one group .
then after a while blood was supposed to build up , causing the vein to show up so you can see it through ur skin .
oh yeah rebecca 's hair looked like a gigantic cornrow lol .
i 'll learn in time though .
with many ups and downs , and gas prices that are more ridiculous than tye dye t-shirts .
did n't do my presentation today as we ran outta time .
but yeah it overall went pretty well .
now to see what my courses are like for university lol .
*wump* *3.5 hours later* yes i 'm awake and well now ... ..
everyone played `` when summer takes flight . ''
too many to explain .
so after working on some theory ... ...
but yeah they actually sounded ok for once .
this is my last entry before tc ... .
dun dun dun ... ... ...
and annoying .
and many other problems occured this morning lol .
after helpin ' her w/ her project *no names mentioned* we started talkin ' n ' stuff , and then by the end ... ..
whoo .
i tried helping too , but i failed to get it to work = ( .
and i did .
least she told the truth and wo n't just rip off her patients .
lol .
dunno how i got onto that topic ... .
it 's actually pretty cool game ... .
well now round two *ding* round two was full of crazy stuff .
first time in my badminton career at least ... .
then was time for science .
i for one did n't really mind it , and in the end enjoyed it like any other sunday .
good job today haha .
lo and behold ... ..
at the moment i ca n't really think that well because i 'm kinda half tired ... ..
but yeah my blog is n't about the future it 's about well the sorta present ... ..
sad how he could n't figure out i was typing for the both of us .
boss yelled at her too i think from what thompson heard .
sad dan just sad lol .
might give you a little bit of encouragement there buddy .
dunno what the others were doing but i had to go change into my suit for toronto .
sitting there trying to think of a way to compensate ... ... .
well after going through that , i got out of the music room and was on my way to ... ... ...
ca n't wait to meet up w/ them , ju and everyone else from tc again this march break .
like i said lots of stuff .
right now ... ..
has really good music ^_^ .
pass this on to every1 on your list '' first of all i had a deja vu feeling ... .
well we had a word of prayer and then the sermon .
we were perfectly on time .
i honestly liked the 3rd place battle more than the 1st .
but the ones in my class *except for bradburn he seems to be able to do something* all ca n't play anything .
our old hype counsellor , he was pretty much the dude who formed the fellowship .
and @ 3 i headed out to session @ ucc .
i think i 'm doing ok .
* so yup ...
i really liked the 2nd one more as we had more discussion also , and ...
yeah not much else to say ... ...
well ... ...
3/29/04 out with the old month ( almost ) and new with the in ( almost ) grr if it were n't for time ... ..
which was kinda gross so i rushed downstairs to grab a band aid ...
again .
brlliance of putting two heads together !
civics class we just studied once again .
he slowly made his way to the drawer and threw the knife back in .
and of course i checked hockey pool while in class ... .
oh yeah and some inklink with lina earlier before pool lol .
point is we were bashing on finlan a lot .
wow ... ... ... ..
and our church takes four hours to download it ... ..
it 's 6am .
first one : got ta be the craaaazy dedication that i saw my counselor sumair have from being a `` sorta '' muslim guy to a devoted christian .
oh yah k-2 i would n't mind either .
up until now when i think about it we were all being complete jackasses to one another , and that is n't cool in our eyes ... ... .
he plays mixed i think ... .
if it 's anything like the previous reps nothing 's gon na happen =p .
well the day before march break .
reverend li .
saw pirates of the caribbean ( again ) and bowling for columbine ...
for example ... .
well anyways these two words ... .
hmm i have no paper .
and finally hometime ... ...
i quickly fell asleep as i was dead tired ...
well i mean i went to service and everything ...
really sets the max bar much higher for me .
my screenshot was taken in photoshop , and somehow i fooled jason into thinking that he owned photoshop .
so powerful .
we talked about editorial cartoons and actually had less than 10 pages of notes to take .
well anyways gettin late .
well in the morning i hobbled around in my sleeping bag ...
me and john still managed to shut out one team , and keep all the teams below 10 points .
hmm ... ...
well after a while i decided to check out what 's on tv .
the brass group i 'm in actually sounds pretty good now ... ..
i think he 'll be a strong follower in christ in no time .
no .
really wan na see em make it into playoffs ... ...
a lot .
i seem to be the only person in gr.10 music that understands the game lol .
tommy : yessssss ( getting tired of the questions this time ) .
played some basketball .
while i was on the 2 hour long car ride to toronto and back from attending david and tommy 's dad 's pastoral ordination ... ...
it 's so long ... ... ..
also we talked a little bit about skills when i brought the word into the lesson .
programming ... ... ..
english ...
lunch today i went to get a book for english class .
well at least i play my pieces well she said .
* and then threw up afterwards .
but then they left .
oh well off to civics .
oh yeah and of course the white kids hehe .
hammond did a family physician where he interviewed his mom .
god could be doing this for a reason .
i actually played decent today though .
i was tired =p .

really brought up a lot .
4-2 for sens .
30 times i heard ?
oh well ... ..
happy easter everyone !
well it 's ok i guess ...
today though i liked some of the speeches that were put out .
but i do n't expect every person that watches the movie to ball their eyes out afterwards .
i seem to be having success ... ...
i kinda was 20 minutes late lol .
oh yeah we also got our tests back today finally .
you know like we get to put out our opinions and stuff and they school will sometimes take into consideration if they think it has potential .
exam prep week is gon na be pretty crowded and jammed up for me .
but the asap turned into a long time after it took us about 30 mins to get bus tickets .
i have no clue why either ...
really boring .
for dave rutt ... .
mr. harris was even surprised at us .
that could just be my sprite can that did that ... ..
got there , did this , walked there , threw stuff into locker , and then headed up to history class .
i do n't mind walking around downtown for over 3 hours but they 're legs were hurting ... .
like everything else .
for 2004 , i guess i just hope that this year there wo n't be as many negative things happening in this world ... .
i went to drum for a bit ... .
my day that led to the seeing of one of the finest films i 've seen so far in 2004 .
just today after school ... .
we chilled , got lots of food , and just talked about random crap .
our daily acts is basically how people judge us ... .
oh well ...
amazing how fast time goes by lol ... .
we played for a bit , and then heard some song on a cd .
i think i aced a trigonometry test ... .
well yeah after that came lunch .
1/25/04 first pastoral ordination attended in life ...
then got home ... .
so that 's why i also kinda felt bad for them since 250 of the 500 going to semi are 9ers .
i 'll blog more tomorrow .
i mean subway is self explanitory to look good ... ...
where i had to wait for underhill , okanski and robert to head down to my place to do some work on our project ...
it 's the same thing as jasper 's but more expensive .
but yeah the game was kinda amusing , but tiring .
but back to the main point of my blog ... .
meh decided to play some starcraft *old school game* with some friends .
dunno bout other game .
i walk in the room and instead of the high pitched voice of ms. wiener i heard ...
boring .
watch kill bill vol .
dated celebs , known throughout the world ... ... .
well today was a day 1 so i really do n't care if i 'm late or not .
so yeah at home now ... .
11 's and 12 's blocking our gr .
oh yeah and today was very messed up .
lina and josh kept throwing a tic tac box at me ...
* oh well ... ..
this shows that i 've had my drum set for a while now lol ... ..
blogging ... ...
one group someone looked like mike ... ...
we had lots of talking today ... ... ..
i 'm not about to let go my whole life history =p .
oh yes ... .
not much to write about today .
i mean ... .
and how abortion can bite you in the ass ... ... ..
there 's jason , josh , rebecca , theresa and kurtis .
and a lot of people came today .
i felt kinda shaky .
ugh if only i had my dcam .
so i stayed in lol .
yeah no wonder =p .
well i 'm gone hehe ... .
oh yeah also the english congregation was surprisingly larger than usual today .
music .
i pray that the lord be with their family at this time of grieving and that the close family and friends of the zhangs may also be with them at this time .
someone else that 's heard of sylver ? !
it 's the first of the many future weeks ... .
* but after taking up our scores..
anime part in the movie is crazy .
whoo !
was n't too exciting ... ...
we put a few in a box to give to wendy ... .
just worse ( ie we do n't get to go to zoo like the other classes = @ ) .
well though science exam was @ 12 , me and jason decided to go study at the library before the exam .
theory was usual ... ... ...
now knowing me i 'm somewhat paranoid , so i bought my shares @ 1 dollar each then sold them all when it only went up to 8 .
com i guess .
today 's message was about `` wanting to really know christ . ''
sleep time i think .
we got a pic of me and mitch on the broken seat , i was in the air and mitch being the counterweight was on the ground .
i 'd like to do that with my careers presentation ... ..
of course i was also listening to the radio .
h ?
since i had a bottle of bawls *it 's a high caffeine drink not what it sounds like you friggin pervs and shmucks* and also just the trip was waaay to exciting lol .
just have a nice day =p .
did n't do much ... .
now i wan na see pulp fiction and reservoir dogs lol .
i was at my piano lesson today and when i read the date `` february 28th '' i thought sweet tomorrow 's march !
instead we watched two boring videos *shudder* where i slept for one and watched the other since it was actually somewhat action packed *gasp .
well now it was 2nd part of the jam .
on the side i also like to `` counsel '' people w/ their problems ... ...
unfortunately , i 'm not interested in it ...
: i killed your rabbit !
then i called up age , thompson , josh , jason , and adrian for sc .
lol it was funny though .
your jokes suck !
well yeah today was pretty frickin boring .
unless he going to university ...
now i have three fields i could enter : business , law , and sciences .
well he can handstand which i was surprised .
yet so short also .
we did a lab today where we ran around da school with those trundle wheel thigns measuring out hallways .
hopefully it does something .
on a broken mat .
but yeah it was kinda funny ... ..
listened to a gospel on 105.9fm and then when we got to jason 's house ... .
*uh who cares ?
unfortunately i got dropped off on the other end of the school , so i had to lug my luggage to the other side .
keep fit and have fun *body break dun dun dun dun dun dun .
so chatted with john , travis , and nick for most of the class , since i got all my homework done over the period .
mr. brown came in to teach a bit of civics .
in the end jason had to take carmen 's spot since well she kinda ... .
successful !
*kaboom !
i mean some of the other sermons i remember very well .
but still ... ... .
ended up talking most of the time .
right when i leave they arrive .
when i can barely keep track of the present hehe .
also i do n't have to worry because we got updated marks again .
dead tired ... ..
hmm ... ... ...
yeah ... ...
teacher : tommy , do you see the grass outside ?
just picture beethoven ... ...
no lab !
yeah i 'm out for the night anyways ... ..
i really regret buying a ps2 now .
oh yeah and heading back into class ... ...
well after dumping most of my junk in my locker , i preceded heading to first period : music class .
and now i 'm sitting here .
eventually the stock hit 68 .
nothing .
got bored , then went on msn .
to the point so bad east was officially unofficially west .
got home after lesson ... ..
but yeah now i 'm sitting here , blogging , and doin h/w .
yeah that really shot in my mind `` joe , jesus did a lot for you ...
i 'm out for this entry .
for the next few days we would be studyin ' the book of nememiah , and how he rebuilt the city of jerusalem after permission granted by the babylonian king and also after it had been razed to the ground .
but jason and john had to go to webstation after a 20 minute talk about sc .
if you do n't know what song that is ... .
or do some more piano practicing .
wow was it amazing .
i had my share of the fun cutting up the pig , and cracking the rib cage .
lauren got bored and started drawing a group picture of us on the scoresheet *we have open space since we have only 4 people in the class now , * which really shows how bored we can get .
after finding out all the people were inside already ... ... .
you can see why it takes me almost 2 hours to write a exam out of 20 .
i did n't really do much played defense and pretty much just cleared the puck ...
and we totally sucked .
but in the end i somehow ended up w/ hammond and lindsay and them because well dave sorta lost us and went w/ dl and craig ... ...
mmmmmm ... ...
hype has always been as blast since it came about .
gavin complimented carmen on her new outfit ... .
then headed out for the park ...
sun tai geen hong ( be in good health ) i think that one 's important because to me it 's telling you ... ...
great bloggin ' yesterday eh ?
finlan and pourier for now ... .
so we chilled around for a bit before we were told to head downstairs for lunch .
the first place person though did really good .
josh did play but he went to play gunbound after a while .
talked to arjun on the way there .

probably best player at lcac .
15 minutes of riding in a car ... .
sorta ...
got the score from antoine haha .
but yeah i was sorta ticked off @ the time when we coulda stopped at timmy 's , or mr. sub , or wendy 's .
chilled ... .
hehe it 'd be awesome if i ended up being a tromboner in lys .
with my knowledge of wedge-tool dynamics , i concluded that no wedge-tool could have removed a rock of that magnitude with such magnitude !
better than nothing .
i left about 3/4 of the way through since i learned everything i thought i hd to learn ... ..
february 19th *huntsville* or january 1st *new years .
we went down with him and said bye then we split up again lol .
*one hour later* 11am ! ?
and reminded me of the acts thing to help with basic layout of prayer .
well like usual mike was a jackass , john was being bitched at , courtney still needs pms pills , nick was also a shmuck for a bit .
lol it was funny watching jason 's style of play compared to thompson .
i sometimes think now that the dream i had a while back about our english congregation growing quickly , may be true .
but i 'm happy march has gone by in a way .
i felt so isolated .
wow just our luck .
as for my church dream ... ..
whoops ehehehehehe=p .
and i quickly rush out to car and dad drove me to theory class ... .
yay i 'm that much closer to graduating !
someone needs to calm down o_0 .
yeah lots of talk about that , and of course our usual fooling around `` dbz hand clapping ! ''
arrrrrrgh ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
`` senior band this morning .
it leads to really retarded math through the future ... .
oh yah and shaunvir .

wow i ca n't wait until gr .
mmmmm ... ... ... ..
we watched pearl harbour and a documentary on the actual battle .
we actually had a pretty good convo .
about a `` nutrition rave '' in los angeles somewhere .
but now they had to go another way ... .
pretty weird ... ..
so my day started off at 720am like usual , and got ready and stuff and left the house around 750 .
amazing though ... ...
oh wait hammond was still with us i think at this time .
* and off to brian 's .
then the first game against jason .
why would n't my d-cam work for this trip ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! !
they were waiting for parents , so chatted with them for a bit .
mike , dan , and carmen did n't attend this service though .
`` oh no i 'm screwed '' our protagonist joe thinks to himself .
we were there for bout two hours .
and josh still owes me 2.50 hehe .
whoo .
tell the others i said hi = ) .
it 's been amazing how my marks are actually managing to go up ... .
handed in book report , and watched the very few people that chose to , do their oral book reports .
just sometimes ms. manson makes it so ... ...
and for 40 minutes icy was struggling to keep pokan and hermann from changing her pw lol .
`` image is nothing '' in my mind was like ... .
argh ... ... .
ate also of course and usual hygiene stuff ... .
more good stuff .
whooooooooo !
we sounded ok i guess ... ... ..
but it was funny what happened today lol .
and as christians of course we would like to see those pews filled with people .
i hate trigonometry .
they wo n't be able to do jack in the playoffs anyways .
and i 'll summarize what happened since most people have probably read this play apparently juliet is already married to romeo ... ..
dave 's kicking me off the comp and i wan na go play gc .
got 65 % on first exam this year ... .
anyways now back to bio .
jehovah , elohim , under jehovah there were a lot of names .
after that , she then said `` great we can do sight reading ! ''
getting there around 8:30 ... ..
bottom line : usa , stay out of another country 's issues ...
looks like the liberals are gone next election ... ..
today 's a lazy day , so i napped whenever i could .
fool ! ''
w ...
so we quickly said a word of prayer ... .
i mite be taking this midterm a bit too seriously ... ... .
and yeah we 'll be packing lots of fun nights and stuff lol ... .
did n't really talk to him though since well he is a bit of a jackass , so i just said `` hey '' and went on with my way .
and yoinked josh 's stuff from my mom 's car and put it into dad 's .
bah .
though i had a bit of an upset stomach , but after a word of prayer ... .
actually i find it really amusing ... ..
nothing very exciting at home today .
cold .
since we have n't even hit pearl harbour yet .
we talked about variables that could stop us from doing this for god , and lindy used nehemiah as an example with building the walls back up for jerusalem to bring pride to god 's people *the israelites* again .
and then trudging out of the bed at around 8:20 .
ms. manson was pretty nice in history , but right when civics kicked in ... ..
hermann went out w/ steve and them and nate was n't at school today .
works sometimes .
i mean why would you charged someone for murder when they were under order to ?
and programming : i 'm definitely not taking it next year ... ..
today was ... ... ... ...
-lunch : ate subway @ galleria .
but yeah i got to school at 8 , chatted with some people for a bit *until 8:30* and then went to room 136 to write my exam .
and i walk in thinking i 'm late ... .
eventually brescia , jeff , and some other people would come too .
then when we were walking home dan said that mrs. howard called him a loser *lol* cuz he went up to her and said `` hey mrs. howard i might be suspended tomorrow . ''
it was riverdance sorta ... ..
overall though it was alright i guess ... ...
the blood vessels one .
i 'm not trying to sound like a geek ... .
8 of us lol .
=p .
well after history came ... ..
well i 'm cutting funding this week and next week ... ..
`` a good shepherd dies for his sheep , '' that statement means a lot more to me now than before probably .
uhh ... .
after getting the tickets ... ...
3/1/04 whoa ... .
after some group games *my group owned lol* we went out for food break and a short message from pastor d. spoke about paul and his testimony in the bible .
hitler 's childhood really sucked .
but band was n't too bad today .
i 'm not 40 just yet hehe .
i was thinking how boring history could get ... .
we watched a video on the life of adolf hitler today ... ..
blips here and there ... .
it was pretty boring .
for the next two days we would watch the movie .
but it was a lot of fun ... ..
ms. wiener gave the weirdest face at that .
* today originally started off looking gloomy .
well after announcements it 's time to go to science .
gon na snowboard tomorrow and i do n't wan na fall asleep on my way down the bunny hill .
and then i had to buy a prize for our bio presentation ... ...
eeew i should smack my head against the wall for that ... ..
you know the one w/ keanu reeves , some chick and they are struggling to keep a bus going so it wo n't explode ?
so yeah i guess he was a pretty awesome pm ... .
so i ended up waiting 40 minutes out there for nothing .
well the memories of 2003 and well the first 4 days of 2004 where there was no school will be in my head for a while ... ... .
yeah when me gavin and rebecca thought we knew what the passages meant ...
he did so much for us , starting the fellowship , and just giving us the chance to really grasp what a fellowship is like ... ..
not saying it 's bad but i wish dictatorship was there at that moment so i 'd win ^_^ .
examples include calvin 's bragging about how he can turn his hat 360 degrees on his head without use of his hands *he twiches his head like 1000 times* or josh 's comments on white forks ... .
stupid june *shakes fist .
well after the movie i played ddr with josh at silvercity .
i had to go though @ 7:30 ... .
mr. harris *i think that 's him* walked by and told us about how back in the 80 's that there were actually school competitions across the city ... .
i mean spending 350 bux on an outfit , plus shoes , and in girls ' case getting their hair done and etc , it can really be costly .
gavin dave and jenn just gave a pathetic `` joe you suck '' sorta nod and i sat there going ... ..
so when we arrive at saunders ... .
hopefully they win tonight , and if they do n't well hopefully the road game trend continues , as that means calgary will win =p .
like say drink up half a bottle of wine while on msn like i did a while back ... .
but yeah ... ... ... ..
so well ... .
to begin my march break sunday ...
it was pretty cool , and moving .
lose st. louis please .
anyways , around 7 or so called up marcello to head to ucc for a bit .
wait do i ? ''
jokes haha ... .
half our class failed .
this story 's not new ...
just happy they were n't my k-swisses .
i have too many things i want to take .
more food ... ... .
i 'm still in 6th place .
student parliament has started elections so i see .
pimps !
but for once not about a face .
science ... ...
it 's like if it was a hockey game ... ..
well yeah after the speaker reverend li pointed that out ... .
doh !
robert was gon na suggest to tell him to blow his nose ... .
this was a great note to end on from the whole week .
programming nothing exciting .
but ignoring that , the cutting up of the pig and exploring the insides of it was still as amusing as before =p .
early this morning , local prostitute turned catapult dynamics enginner dr. mary magdeline was going to pay her respects to jesus , a recently crucified carpenter/teacher when she found the tomb opened .
( or sunday school ... .
is there anyone here that 's new that 'd like to introduce themselves ? ''
then talked ... ...
so picked up lina ... .
ugh well least i can still hop w/ handstands .
i guess typing up that book report of mine really spurred my typing fingers right now .
me jason and dan were on a team .
i have civics in the same room i have history ... .
i came across gavin 's .
and then i 'd end up cheering for ... ..
last time i recall doing that was grade 5 .
then jessica wittaker came for a visit to us .
ca n't walk around outside or my eyes kill ... ... ..
so after that , well we were all pretty dead tired .
he 's a hippie !
and i had to do ushering this morning in place of grace since she was doing praise and worship .
*poink* wait !
he woke up at 430am for rowing .
well apparently my eyes have kinda got better *no more dry eye syndrome if you know what that is* but i did n't get prescription .
last team from central to have it occur to us .
bummer .
mostly places like athlete 's world and foot locker and stuff .
so we all just chiilled downstairs for a bit .
every station played the crummiest music i 've heard in my life ... .
i feel bad for teefy and whitney though putting up with that lol ... .
so far it 's consisted of sleeping , sleeping , and dreaming lol .
it was n't as hard as cracking the ribs , but much more sound effects .
lol lots of talk about b-ball ... ... ..
* and a lot of people disappear ( god comes back for his people . )
and i found it .
one about my church and one about lcd monitors .
so yeah ... .
have n't worn it in a while ... ..
so i prayed for the safety of the drivers and of the safety of the people around it .
i could n't really eat though .
but when i got to band today .
josh and calvin then went downstairs to set up stuff ...
got ta remember that .
what 's comin up next ?
gay gay gay .
well after that ... .
his snare playing was so technical ... .
argh sunday i 'm gon na be cooped up inside doing 3 projects blast .
i wonder if i am a bit more optimistic than many people ?
it 's 3 bucks of fried potatoes .
basically the main message through the scripture ( galatians 5:13-18 ) says that if you live under christ 's faith ... ..
then class started .
anyways it was n't brown anymore ... ..
yup ... ... .
crack .
just made it ontime to school around 8:10 .
and wow history class got off to a really lame start .
but i really find this history unit boring .
was thinkin ' bout playing ball but was gon na go play badminton w/ lina around 5pm anyways so just stuck around at home .
i slept through most of class ... ..
still though i think i 'll still be d/l music ... .
then she totally burns the trombone section ( not including me cuz i do n't play the song she was making fun of =p ) .
well we ended up only practicing for an hour and a half or so ... ..
so anyways after pondering for a few minutes about whether i was talking out loud while sleeping or not ... .
became a tradition .
predestination ?
and up next ... ..
i actually understand the concept of html ... .
and english we read , and was reminded about the upcoming book report ... ... .
so his 7 dollar debts been paid ... ..
so yeah headed upstairs ... .
snow football !
beats bio .
in their faq sheet , they brought out something that really hit me .
lol first off though we had wrong 007 theme for our opening ... ... ...
i want like a dark green one if there 's such thing .
it was pretty awesome , and also now i 'm hoping that we could have the coffeehouse with wlac .
which is really gay how that happened ... .
because after we started playing another song ... ..
we had music council elections !
food !
so finally ... .
wow one day to do a 75 min project ... ... .
not the coolest thing playing your team ... .
so lame .
stupid global warming .
and it was crammed .
mmmm fritos are soooo good .
well we left school around 2:40 ... ..
i mean 4 days you can do some stuff ...
and it says # 6 on the back .
i just never saw it .
jason decided to come too today .
but it was a really packed day ... .
heh and she also brought up another subject , the fact that after sex girls and guys care waaay more about pregnancy than something like std 's .
really is an awesome feeling .
whipped right through it .
he sounds like a drunk at the front of the room when he talks to us .
bio class : joe failed/chinese failed/probably usual failed the test i think .
well after that i played some sc ( starcraft if you have n't caught on from my previous entries ) and then ate and left for ucc .
basically i sat in front of the comp chattin ' to tc kids , reorganizing comp , and just lookin at the 97+ pics i took while on vacation hehehe .
ushered for a bit before brian finally got there , and wendy took my spot in place of gloria .
i had two apples = ) .
well hope for the best ...
breakfast consisted of leftovers from wendy 's house yesterday from dinner .
i decided i was n't going to go to boler today .
anyways ... ... .
well originally i was chilin w/ craig and dave w. for boarding ... .
and i mean he 's actually smart .
so i got a ride to school ...
overlooked papers ... ...
well did n't work ... .
i 'm almost done hyperstudio project though ... ...
my now treasured ... ...
too lazy to blog today ... ...
but it looks really stupid .
and oh yeah i switched jason 's msn name ...
now it 's already january 22nd ... ...
but the best part of tonight had to be the song that goes with the movie `` nitrogen is a common earth element . ''
we got a lot further into the game .
chatted for a bit before i realized my bus was making the turn ... .
and my weekends seem to be pretty jumbled now .
it 's really addictive .
not much happened in class .
so got ready for music and stuff , arjun has figured out the accompinament for my trombone solo which is good news .
`` well yeah instead of that it 's now `` hi eddie ... ... ... ... ... ..
yeah but note to self : never canvass during march again .
ucc was 2nd plan come to think of it , since me and john planned to go gaming earlier =p .
it was such a weird thing that katie decided to take a pic of it .
wow i coulda made 13,600 but noooo i sold mine early and made only 1100 bux .
downside of normal average day 1 : double period in same room w/ same teacher .
why not save someone else 's life if i could ...
the good book said he would rise in three days .
it 's still sorta halfway done only lol .
why would n't you ?
when you get eliminated by sta 1 and then lose to saunders 3 ... ..
oh yeah and the t-wolves won ^_^ .
o0o0o0o matchmakers came out today .
but even if i wanted to nap i would n't have been able to .
whoot i got hit .
gettin ' old i guess *shrug* but i 'm aiming for contacts and a new pair ... .
i was surprised , but not complaining lol .
but there has to be a reason .
craig simpson or sometin like that was talking about how usa spends way too much time on helping other countries , when their country is suffering enough .
* zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz .
hmm ... .
but i really despise geometry ... ... ..
then after channel surfing for about 30 seconds lo and behold ... ... .
he then said the thing about how in the 80 's how there were citywide school competitions .
muahahahahahahahahahaha suffer !
after band had to make an appointment to get my uniform for senior band ... ..
hmm ... ...
apparently icy finds a plastic school chair a pretty formidable melee weapon .
i think he 's the one that patrick 's dad said really sucks lol .
plus ... ... ..
two still live i heard .
but i still hate the name brand .
they played a easy piece , a piece that we learned last year and managed to beat us out .
but decided that 's too hard so i 'm gon na maybe make a robber steal something ... ..
weird ... ..
but today 's sermon , i do remember two of the prayer items in particular : -victor in australia recently had a car accident *pray for healing* -the movie passions victor i 've known for a bit now since he originally attended lcac , and truthfully he was the one that introduced me into serving christ in the congregation .
this is when i feel sorry for the next person staying in our hotel room .
westminister like i said sucked ... .
after that class ... .
so after finally managing to find my stuff , and get myself settled ... .
i felt as though it was speeding by ... .
in fact yeah i think i 'll try to pay attention more and not act like a jackass .
i wish i was taller lol .
science ... .
people around us : o0o0o0o0o joe and calvin are first up ( these people bein stefan , sergei , etc . )
it was off to history class .
lots of talk about the rockets vs. lakers game last night and the flames vs. canucks triple overtime .
played pokan today ... ..
so yeah i 'm cutting back on food lol .
click urllink here =p .
so quickly bought a lunch *well actually thompson bought it* and then went to math .
since i dunno what the heck happened to the others lol .
* well a different twist in cars too .
some hope for me and john 's badminton career =p .
if a teacher does n't see you ... ..
so the only time i should have been moved by this story ... .
jesus , god and the spirit are kinda the same , but are three different factions .
*shudder* that guy was weird .
lots about huntsville .
all we did today though was scales ... .
talked for a bit ... ..
gah foiled once again by freedom ... .
so yeah room was pretty quiet ...
one of these days they 're prolly gon na pay a student to do the teaching , or something .
and the sun seemed really bright .
well eventually the time was up , and after some good laughs , it was time to go .
and me and gavin 's shallowness ... ..
i do n't know why they have been emphasizing this since grade school .
spelling ? )
so i actually slept for 30 minutes , before meg tanner poked me , waking me up .
we got exams back .
i think there were about 15 different names .
well i 'm gone .
-lunch : studied like maaaaaaaaaaaaaaad ... ...
now i wo n't ruin much about the movie ... .
so researched for 75 minutes on our economy ... .
today we learned about how basically the whole english term `` two heads are better than one '' saying works .
maybe the others do n't feel the same way as i did ... .
afterwards had dinner and etc .
now i know how rich people feel ... .
we killed that thing .
but he screws around a lot lol .
i 'll call it that when they win stanley cup sometime in the next ... ...
almost got to shool late lol .
no way !
`` yup ... ...
ugh ... ..
civics class ... ... .
first time in 4 weeks we 've had to do that ... .
i do n't even kno why the hell we have to do that stuff .
this year 's was just so slow moving and crappy i fell asleep for most of it .
although i lost , but i made some would-have-been decent doubles shots .
* so giving up on sleep , went to drum for an hour or so , then sc .
really feel proud for em .
argh .
i mean talk is good ... ..
yeah so i started doing that for around ... ... ... ... ...
some were willing to pay 50 bux .
first reaction when i saw him `` gabe ! ''
did n't realize that at the moment ... .
effective ^_^ .
unfortunately i kinda got injured lol .
yeah my blog formats are all beginning to look the same .
and onto science class .
played baddy at ucc w/ lina .
entrusting christ with more and more of my life ... .
cya .
anyways yeah this is gon na be a 3 part blog , so grab whatever you need to be comfy ; you know a blanket , chips , pop ... .
thank goodness .
feet lol .
hmm other than that my day 's been really tiring ... .
not your average saturday ...
blast it 's raining .
`` quick steph unleash all your anger before that holy water hits you tomorrow ! ''
ate some stuff , blogged for now ... .
yeah me and gavin went overboard on the burnages lol .
it 's actually really cool to see .
it was same old @ school ...
so yeah i 'm out kids .
now back on the subway .
as josh and gavin mentioned over march break i seem to be the only person that likes to take 6-hour walks around downtown toronto and still be smiling about it hahaha .
like a prayer of some sort before the day starts .
took off my hat and lo and behold ... ...
yeah i was thinking about this and this is what stopped me for a while today .
picked up jason and then english service here i come !
though my life is more jumbled than ever .
everyone had to do something it seemed today ... ... .
apparently there 's like 9 books or sometin in the series now .
but we all still managed to sign her journal and jt 's before the day was at end .
after that day of school , went home for a bit , and then stars of the festival , where our band did n't do amazing , but we sounded decent .
relieved w/ comedy ... ...
mr. mccumber today did n't get pms .
i mean i do n't mean to complain ... .
got the bill and left .
tc is around this time ... .
tried new ps2 game , got good final project mark in careers , and surfed the net in programming .
well actually i think we got there only 2 minutes earlier than 8:10 cuz i heard bell go right off after i went in .
waking up was really difficult today .
so yeah what a good waste of 10 mins=p .
but the subject was about `` our commision . ''
brings back many memories .
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
also got ta find my band uniform at bud gowan 's tomorrow for kiwanis on tuesday .
first impression for me : i hit someone 's music off a stand ... .
shining with our victory reported the score , and then waited for our next game ... .
and me and hammond are prime examples lol .
problem is though ...
when you have two room 314 's it 's pretty difficult to set up meetings .
for lunch ... .
jokes .
today 's topic was about spiritual gifts , spiritual fruits and talents , and how they are all different .
we actually do sound good ... ..
hard to explain but the people that saw it ... ... ..
i do n't think anyone else really knew about this around me , but it was a time of silence ...
first of all it 's pathetic how he stole that line from nate cuz it was an inside joke .
the movie .
i thought that craze was over um ... ... .
also , i was really hungry @ 11 ... ..
mmmmmmm .
he 's really getting better at ball .
yes the rest of hype once again chimes in with ooooooh 's and lol 's .
why did i never stumble on this stuff earlier ! ?
see not very exciting except for that one highlight .
through many toils and fatigue ... .
wow have n't done this reflecting stuff in ages .
mmmm ... ... ... ..
*gasp .
production at its best =p .
so the action packed exam week is starting tomorrow .
and funny also ^_^ .
who can forget lunch and then jammed ... ..
* anyways yeah ... ... ... ... ..
more drums lol .
you would n't believe how many canadians made big bucks from making homemade beer .
but i dunno where the heck spencer went , or the twins .
thanks a bunch = ) .
normally i mean i 'll sometimes make a few jokes and laugh a bit ...
all that money ... ..
so yeah we chatted for a while , 'bout random stuff , then headed back to school ... .
also ... .
wow what a joke .
ha .
on the bright side got to miss some school , see some friends at kiwanis and play t-bone .
he can already do 120 in gr .
what 'd i do ?
i guess i 'm just thinking about what 's going to pop up in my life this week .
the actual battle was a lot more gruesome probably ... ...
we had to temporarily be evicted from our usual room due to re-painting , so we just read this class and listened to mrs. gayed read for almost 40 minutes .
i got reminded of school again when david was complaining about the 2 pages of math homework he has for this march break .
and then headed out to school at around 745am or so .
i think that without studying ... .
well normally we give parting gifts to people when they leave *which we did , * but in return ali being the cool counselor she is gave us all personalized bookmarks .
while passing by mykono 's this time ... .
well now ... .
but it was funny watching it in the making haha .
kinda cool to see em i guess after march break= ) .
we actually have a decent team too .
interesting how gavin brought a friend .
so far i have $ 5 .
well i 'm out for the night ... .
so yeah today lunch was a bit of talk about hockey ...
or a desk from staples .
met up with john ...
looked like skiing .
well my mom would .
i just feel so much more open and ready to spread christ 's word and also just seeing people like jenn , sumair and many others suffer so much more for christ than me ... .
but before i close this long entry , i 'd just like to say to everyone ... ... ... ...
well in the end i 'd make profits back by mining from the base .
oh well ...
it 's like one of those female spiders that backstabs her mate by eating him after mating .
so yeah not much .
this blog will be awesome !
i 've had some great times ... .
got a bit bored after school so decided to take that little survey .
got to school pretty early actually which was surprising .
and yeah thanks again god for lighting up my day = ) .
bused home in really heavy winds .
ryan 's pretty much stuck on same street as him =p .
shweet ... .
damn .
also i kinda left a bit late cuz my mom was complaining about sometin ... .
kinda funny how he 's our `` motivational '' speaker , though western this year was just over the .500 win mark .
a new girl joined .
and of course the other things too lol .
had a lesson though at least .
hmm what else happened ... .
lol ... .
well with so many influences in this world ... ..
whoo .
maybe the reason why i 'm writing little today is because i forget most of the stuff .
the gruesome smell of preservatives ... .
and i kinda regret it lol .
but yeah i think john 's gon na kill me tomorrow lol .
unfortunately i do n't remember the dreams that well now ... ...
one being ... ... .
another one of lindsay 's friends .
at least i catch up fast ... .
oh wait would n't that be worth 10 bucks then =p .
t ... ... ... ..
and now for once i 'm gon na go try to sleep earlier than usual .
in the end i made it to marcello 's house around 4ish or so .
i think i saw my careers teacher in the train too =s .
but then again a nice environment to worship in does affect people .
i for myself had a pretty good day , beginning with a theory exam .
cept my king and jason still had king , queen , and a knight .
15 minutes passes by pretty quick .
well after tc 2004 ... .
uh huh .
but it was switched for the best .
maaad games lol .
mmmm ... ..
lates .
the avalanche won again !
practice for the ddr competition tomorrow ... ... ... ..
we all left by 9 .
before i say anything else , i 'm happy to see people blogging again !
but anyways i got ready for school like usual , and then headed out the door for a expected average day 1 .
made my team better ...
oh yeah now programming class ... .
`` obey your thirst '' =p .
gavin still learns guitar off him so yeah i guess he 'd remember gavin pretty well hehe .
well yeah just finished devos and ... ...
but i 'm thinking this could work ... ..
senior band tomorrow .
not really many people , so i went on sc .
i ended up sitting inside for the whole lunch doing english .
trying to control 22 kids at once is not a fun thing to do .
and have a time magazine bag lol .
actually no one was harmed lol .
yeah i know today ... ...
what i thought the message was this morning was that in order to fully believe in god ... .
anyways i 'm out now .
2003 was kinda a flash .
then talked about our editorial cartoons .
in order of playing ...
i also took a few pics of final worship , and a video or two hehe .
my sleep deprivation is soaring still ... ..
some people afterwards told me that the first assembly was better , and ours was cut short .
finally i can watch a good team play .
but more on that after the beginning of my day ... ...
for the duration of 50 minutes that it lasts .
then you will be protected from the grasp of satan .
well i 'm gon na go finish up work then do devos then sleep .
but anywho this morning i had fried rice *mmmmm* and then did the rest of morning routine and headed out the door .
well first game i tried too hard and got tired and then just let myself get tagged , but we still won !
see kill bill vol .
anyways now time for our feature presentation .
it 's like charades ... .
but i do remember the memory verse was hebrews 9:14 , which reads : `` how much more , then , will the blood of christ , who through the eternal spirit offered himself unblemished to god , cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death , so that we may serve the living god ! ''
tofu ... ...
so i gave jason my 5 , and the 10 would pay for the both of us .
90 degree angle writing .
well one thing that i brought up *also thanks to josh for putting this into an analogy ...
wow .
oh yeah and also got to start talkin ' to gerty 's friend joy , who was in my workshop .
but then again i think i may have got cut because well the 9ers basically make it on by default for experience , and pokan plays decent .
that is all .
we got to the subs place and lo and behold ... ..
boxes for these things are so small compared to crt ones .
20 minutes or so then headed home .
well more like by coincedence ... ..
home ... ...
bleh today had its good times and its bad times .
and i 'm back .
etc .
was gon na go for singles but hermannator , brandon and hoffman wasted him .
oh yeah almost forgot rasberry social or sometin like that .
just science i 'm worried about .
you lose underdog =p .
anywho i 'm out for the night .
so therefore we do n't owe him anything =p .
the little kids are really annoying , especially jordan and jacky in my opinion .
the struggle to walk to jasper 's .
detroit .
ergh hopefully i do well ... .
also he pissed off usa , and united the french ... ..
friday !
very boring and tiring .
*class in pure silence* ms. manson : april fools !
and since i 'm a talkative one ... ... ..
the interior i like a lot ... ..
java , mocha , mud , cup o ' joe ... ..
played sc ... ..
mmmmmm ... ... ... .
pretty cool atheist .
i sat in front of the 88 key wooden block for 15 minutes then decided to take a 30 minute nap , which got prolonged into a 11 hour slumber .
there 's 10 spots .
of course not ... ... .
talked to ryan and patrick on the way home ... ..
maybe because me and mitch did it co-operatively i think haha .
up until now at home already i miss tc 2004 already lol .
60 bpm hehehe .
so after 60 minutes of that boredom ... ..
after all the thanking and final cheers ... .
no one was there .
so all i could really do was play post and shoot from inside the perimeter .
reluctant to get up since the night before i spent most of my time on msn and looking at random websites , i was pretty tired when i woke up .
300 jap planes ?
w ... ... ...
well while waiting for parents , managed to fit in one round of ddr ... .
after chattin ' for a bit , we headed down then .
ahh yes sleep my favourite part of a car ride ...
i personally thought we did a pretty good job on this project .
and then ucc .
least i got to miss school = ) .
overheard some bet between hermann and pokan for one dollar .
after finally getting back into kiwanis after a year ... ...
today 's class sucked ... .
however if you have two even built oxen , the job is done faster , quicker , and the things you accomplish in life may look better ( better quality plowed field ) .
i think i 'm gon na start goin ' on regular basis .
we bought some stuff at angelos to eat then went home .
* well honestly we did n't sound terrible ... ...
i just stretched and then did my common stuff .
i 'll probably blog in more detail tomorrow .
after that ... .
the second feat that god showed me of himself was the whole tc 2004 day two .
oh well ... ... .
done .
ha .
so left a bit later , picked up lina , and then headed for church ...
hilarious night though .
joe : umm maybe you could use the big knife ?
hehe .
and then back up to 74 .
in the end ... ... .
hmm somehow got ta make it after conference lol .
well they called 4 numbers , it was a 4 on 4 , and when i went to get the ball froun the boundary line ... ..
in a matter of a year or two josh lo can be a counselor .
well yah after that i kinda napped for a bit ... ..
jason solved that problem .
i forgot lots of the crap we 've learned .
well now i guess i 'll be headed to lcac for hype .
stupid form ...
she said i woulda died during the depression .
other people that got knocked out first round included lots of people that go to ucc usually on fridays and stefan/igor also got knocked out first round i think .
20 years ago ?
maybe ?
then 10 quiz questions come up ... ... .
apparently when i thought i woke up early this morning ... .
afterwards ... ... ..
gimpy in the end kinda beat the crap outta me but s'all good ... ..
back to stinkin ' school .
that got the whole bus laughing lol .
it 's around 2:40am .
for some reason i decided reluctantly to go ... ...
bused , talked to ryan on the bus ... ... ...
saxes seem somewhat musically challenged at times thats all lol .
4/15/04 bouncin ' back from laziness ...
and went to jesse wong 's .
got band still tomorrow .
so we were ready and underway ... ..
lecturing w/ ms. wiener 's annoying `` fallowing 's '' instead of following and other really retarted speech impediments .
have n't played that game in almost a year ... ..
i think that 's what it 's called ... ...
not much else to say =p .
anything i could find .
talking of course =p .
need coffee so i wo n't get bored in math .
finished one slide of presentation when josh then called .
never really realized until today how many people are graduating from university this year .
lol the speaker made fun of chris a bit .
now sitting in room 125 like every other band rehearsal ... ..
played music like usual and stuff .
and then there was igor and stefan 's breaking part of the show .
sorry gavin no sympathy w/ that kind of running skill you deserve to be hit by the wall lol .
do you know that ?
you must follow god 's way .
today i finally convinced mophead *thompson* and nate to go to jasper 's .
open book =p .
if you can ... ..
*shudder .
i have nothing better to do normally so i sc .
well we decided to walk around downtown toronto .
talked you know good times .
yes sadly the english department makes two exams a year , which is a total waste of time as english is an art ... .
`` nitrogen is a common earth element '' is the movie they showed , which is a spin-off of a 007 film .
close competition probably too .
my animated dude kinda walks properly .
also ... .
well i got to school around 8:15 ... .
if it were n't for them ... ..
yeah that 's basically it .
no icy mauling pokan ...
we have been informed we have another exam .
quizie !
i definitely do n't regret going out for lunch .
yes way lol .
other than that right now i do n't really plan on doing much today ... ...
since well his whitehills bus came by .
so yeah ... .
yes i know i am pretty pathetic at fooseball , but meh , last time i played it was in august=p .
bumped into paul nielsen today .
he said he would n't teach us any way new to learn the sharps and flats , but in the end he did anyways ... .
but he does get pissed off when people do n't go to band .
car ride was pretty amusing .
some signed the journals that connie and mike are going to be getting , and the others would do that later .
com ... ... ..
yeah we had good times .
in the freezing -20+ weather ... .
oh wait it 's not over .
but then again , this does happen , and we can only pray for the best for these people .
same w/ gavin and his spiritual gift .
that 's got ta be the worst part about dissecting .
we watched a `` quiz movie . ''
great times this afternoon ... .
for some reason though sport chek was selling ny rangers jerseys for more $ $ $ than jerseys w/ player names .
like usual and for some snacks after service .
after school ... ...
remembering what christ did and of course communion .
mr. curphey broke his leg so we have a sub for the week -lunch we went to mcd 's -bio was fun ...
*shrug* .
i bump into my aunt , uncle , and cousin *i think kora was her name or something like that .
you go too far it leads to anarchy and chaos .
i found a new brand of music to add to my already growing blob of listening music =p .
and im really tired ... .
so yeah did that , and i had ju-pah *aka pork chop* for breakfast .
freeeeedddooooooom !
was so freaking tired .
plus the white pipe that turned into a hat/kung-fu stick lol .
until my dad realized he 's till in his truck and you ca n't really fit that thing in a residential area that well .
not to sell stuff* we then went on about our personal ones .
huge style , mad combos .
listened to some book reports .
i was complaining yesterday about going to toronto for only an hour .
so got to school around 805 , sat around outside for a bit , and then bus boarding we went .
i just do n't get how the week passed by so slooooowly with all that stuff to occupy me .
when gametime came ... ..
by the time i got home ... .
=p .
honourable mention from teacher haha .
but absolutely had no will ... ..
then it poses me with questions of whether god is making me have those dreams or some other supernatural force ?
oh yeah ... ..
yeah i guess i 'm a pretty curious person with things ... ..
with almost everyone bogged in h/w ... .
lates .
and then went on about the theory of how lots of people think they 're so `` ghetto '' when the silver chain they have around their neck is worth more than a house block in say ... ...
i dunno if it 's just me , but it seems as though gloria lives in the same house as steph alexiou , cuz i know they both live on paperbirch .
which means i ai n't the only kid that does n't have their g1 till then .
her , jesse , amanda , and janice were like the pioneers of hype lol .
went to galleria today .
hammond decided to play mitchell .
there goes his victory .
hehe .
usually .
sho shtupahd .
and then got home and got ready for eye exam .
and went to robert 's group .
gah stupid p3 800mhz ... ...
she seems to always wear it on a wednesday like she said lol .
i know for a fact tc 2004 will match it=p .
grr stupid exams wow .
good job jason and keep up the good work !
got it fob style lol .
that will require some thinking lol .
i mean it 's always good to have reminders like that so we wo n't be led astray .
productive .
he could ask the most simple question ... .
just to say now also , i really disagree on how so many people say this movie 's anti-semetic .
beats doing math homework or somethin .
but yeah in the end i think he finally understood we use characters and not every language is based on english rules .
brian took me lina and jt back along w/ felix and ken took calvin , twin # 1 , gavin and jason .
15 mins of cardio , then went upstairs to see how the session was going .
it 's pretty useless .
yeah it 's honestly some of the best times that i think you can have on this earth .
doing a test soon .
yeah far out lol .
right after lunch ... ..
it was pretty difficult to get up on thursday .
it was pretty interesting meeting , and i felt we had accomplished lots of tasks to be completed in that meeting .
i was n't really hungry today , so i decided to play some ball .
this will take me outta the 70 's .
only cover 2/3 of my iris now instead of 99 % .
looked around for about 15 minutes and after figuring that they had everything done already *i do n't know what really had to be done* so i left for my bus stop .
so i ended up staying there for an hour .
now unfortunately all i remember is the msn skit where people were talking over msn about a certain issue , which was pretty funny , but after that unfortunately i kinda fell asleep lol .
and it sounded good , but apparently you do n't win anything in that one .
well yeah this is why i 'm now ending up going to session @ ucc instead .
*shudder .
i 'd push homework to very last priority and drum , chill , snowboard , or do whatever from 230-9 .
*shrug* figure that out later ... .
lates .
but yeah i proved my point in a way .
and here i am now posting my blog .
impatience w/ hooking up the karaoke ... ...
seems like such a long time ago ... ... .
damn was it cold !
after that though it was all pretty easy cruising .
who cares if they were in 1st .
hmm ... ... ..
hmm ... .
out of the bluriness of 4.0 poor eye sight ... ... ..
by the way jenn ... ..
5/19/04 how hk are you ?
since we are doing world war ii .
cheese+tortilla chips+mcdonald 's salsa=somewhat below average nachos !
wow ... ..
on their hasty way , jesus apparently appeared to them .
so headed home then ...
so both of us went `` no way a non-face burn ! ''
i might try finding the 2nd book now too .
today 's class was just a stupid test .
10 math is retarted ... ..
well it was looking good at the beginning ... ... ..
it was a good message too ... ..
yup ... .
gavin payed for my meal since he owed me $ $ $ .
wow it got her cracking up for sure .
haha so jenn 's all alone now with waking up that early .
went to buy pizza ... .
so wendy 's plan worked haha .
to a very sunny morning .
we obviously had some laughs n stuff but it was all pretty mellow .
lol ... ...
would have been humiliating being only school with a bronze ...
wow i 'm amazing =p .
dentists not needed in heaven ?
whoo !
was switching between fm96 and energy a lot .
better late than never as they say .
lunch ... .
the most exciting half of the whole tc .
oh yeah ... ... .
oh well in the end i got 5 pics ... .
but at least she has satellite tv and she cooks really good food .
meh both ways i think i might have made the team ... ..
but seriously would n't anyone get tired of having the same thing 4 nights in a row ?
mike john and i went to stobie 's today .

well then took jason home , and had lunch .
and ctrl+s ... ..

speaking of bibles , i need mine back from shaonan .
well we got to the public school finally ... ..

well i was kinda trudging everything behind schedule this morning ... ... .
probably gon na recommend it to a friend later on .
dad came home .
i wan na stay home .
then on the 3rd i landed on my hip but who cares ? !
we had this one mad play though during the 2nd match .
oh yeah and the `` best '' snowboarder in central took a fall going off the ski lift .
pathetic lol .
two of them apparently have a duet , which i think is pretty cool .
their 90 now for crying out loud leave them be !
* for half the class we listened to some fugue .
lunch ... .
yes !
i 'm talkin ' about like big kahuna tests .
pissed me off too since my compy shut down twice because of power surges *ugh .
i had to wake up earlier than usual .
mr. mccumber was n't too pleased , the rest of the class just laughed lol .
slept ... ..
i hate tiling .
and keep in touch !
played some sc , and now im gon na sleep .
think that was it .
write more tomorrow .
so now all i have to do is withstand this monitor for another week and whoo !
slept , chilled in downtown , and then headed home .
surprisingly without me knowing ... ...
really hope those two dudes can bring their whole family one day ... .
some white guy .
well i made my first game ever in my life today on a computer .
but hey we now know how to make one more fun and ... ... .
yeah so apparently he did move out to grand bend , and lives with his dad now .
yes i passed ... ..
so therefore ... .
in the first class we played `` concorde sketches , '' which i thought we did ok .
see i 'm tired ... .
so after that grueling one hour practice ... ...
hard ...
well now i 'm gon na go eat , finish some piano , then play silent hill 3 for a bit .
*ugh .
whoo !
to conclude my answers to my questions *in order : * -a church takes a lot of time to grow , and i should be patient -there is no such thing as an unblessed church ( a church is a church ...
so anyways i 'm out ... ..
but it 's amazing how i can actually have decent games with people in university ... .
so it 's nice to know also that god 's always there beside me preparing me with my spiritual walk , and also the other things on the way i request help for .
waah !
familiar songs i heard are `` all in all , '' and also this other one ... ...
so brian went to pick her up .
i pulled off a small jump from terrain park and also pulled a manual .
chinese failing is still lingering on the horizon .
later .
12 get a ticket .
picked up jason ... .
wow i never thought we could be so ... ...
and i still need to work on the following : -millz -turtles ( smooth them out ) -smooth out crickets -airchair -inverts*new* -tabletop to forearm to handstand to hops *my year goal other than windmills* -footwork - ... ... ..
to the extreme .
that 's a good thing to see in a doctor of any sort .
no place sells adidas superstars as much anymore .
lol we were between a tractor trailer and our bus and teefy slips on the ice lol .
sayonara .
well when i actually try to do defense lol *this is n't including our one on one games where a pylon is more effective than me jason .
yes once again ms. wiener made fun of me because i 'm somewhat slow .
* well to bio class ... .
i 'm out for the nite .
though he was weird he reminded me of ... .
so yeah better be headin ' to sleep now , and also packing .
and of course who could forget tc ? !
well eventually that village he is preaching in ( btw a village in china is around 700,000 ) now has 4 churches ... .
did some stuff around the house ...
then we played some more nfl street and then jason had to go home .
uh ... ... .
yay ... ..
plus lots of tv today started off normal like usual .
it was a chaotic game .
we finally got our score sheet .
and now i go eat after this blogging hehe .
he had kiwanis again today .
last year 's was awesome .
well not really playing more of shooting around since i was kinda blind but meh ... ..
like i mentioned before me and jessica whittaker *sorry if your reading this jess and i spelled your name wrong =p* were still bugging thompson aboud lindsay pratt and what happened at lunch .
oh yeah and some piano somewhere in there .
about 9/11 a bit and some other stuff .
it was still cool , but the presence of him helped us with our conversations , and really got us somewhere in our spiritual walk .
oh yeah ... .
and also pepsi , and other carbonated drinks .
played some g-cube , talked on msn , and tried getting some tc kids if we found any to come to toronto too .
half of them i bet think it 's just a mid time snack during service .
typing , sc ... ..
and just to listen to some of it ... ...
back to normal whew ... ..
and i 'll be blogging of course on my regular one here=p .
well off to english class and see how our presentation goes .
so start reading !
we ate , and then headed upstairs for some freetime yet again and then our first bible study .
played two melee games with jason then ... ... .
i mean ... ...
wow .
then there 's me joe : yeah i 've been thinkin ' lately that counseling seems pretty cool ... ..
we were supposed to have a bible study , but it got a bit delayed as the little kids were going crazy , and also the church going on there was using the place at the time too w/ us so it was a bit crowded and loud .
did n't do much .
got up , ate , then quickly headed out to church for rehearsal for praise night .
civics we learned about symbols of canada .
so-so .
but i 've never talked to her , or even tried to meet her .
cept for last song lol .
boring .
or just the fact you can snowboard and play basketball even sometimes at the same time of season .
i 'd rather be more amused looking at the food i will be indulging in the next 60 minutes after this retarded class .
i ended up only getting 6 hours of sleep last night since i decided to stay up 'till midnight .
yeah , does n't match up exactly to tony hawk , but closest you can get with stock volkswagen jetta gti 's .
today at english service ... ..
took a shower n stuff ... ...
oh yeah during the game i got a phone call from mike ... ...
it was actually a really good movie .
well that was basically it cuz i 'm not about to type ot the details of note taking .
i would eventually then go upstairs and talk to hammond and korpela for a bit .
* and heather even got this really weird toy ... ..
even with that though ... ..
kinda funny though , it seemed as though school started pretty quickly anyways .
3/9/04 good friday ...
ugh .
so after wasting time like that ... ..
literacy test results ! ?
it was nice to see though .
but lmf is n't bad .
after that though sat around for a bit , drummed , ate , talked to jenn and some others on msn for a bit ... .
i mean i like nas because he actually has stuff to bring out ... .
i was astonished at the fact that lucas had such talented individuals who may have disabilities , but those two literally own some of our musicians in my group .
only another 75 minutes and home time !
slow pleaaaaaaase .
so much conflict lol .
heh i somehow convinced someone that i was a jumping jangaroo ... ..
* so yeah summarizing today : woke up , piano , boring afternoon , and then movie .
but i did n't really play and started studying .
and it hurts .
after the wild english class , bused home w/ ryan .
10 's ca n't count past 4 in music ... .
just a big thank you to her =p* -english ... ..
so we would spend 30 minutes figuring out which one to do ... ... .
*snore* after the day of schoool ... .
well we watched more of finding forrester .
tc 2004 's first day : timeless after a year , i sorta forgot how exciting tc really is .
chatted in the halls with niki and bw and some other people for a bit , and then me and niki headed up to science class .
and jumped out the door around 6:45 or so .
oh yeah today patrick 's ( not finlan the other one , sackville ) modem broke down ... ..
somehow ... .
math h/w 's done , and i 'm gon na now shower and head to sleep .
i wo n't say anything though as i do n't know if she would want me to post it up on my blog .
so yeah i 'll make a better entry tomorrow .
it still worked ...
but wei 's bro fufu *right* would pull off the sickest headspins i 've ever seen .
especially relearned material .
and also the first one for our summer term .
yeah , i 've come to see blogging really does make time seem to pass by so quick .
gave john a lift home ... .
crazyghost crew vs. albino zebra futonics .
some bio and math .
music !
math class did some graphing program .
who the hell cares ? !
er ... ..
3rd person shooters ...
math : finally we start trig !
but jason really seems different .
a few accomplishments made today : -got 22 songs brainstormed for saturday -10 or so themes to think about -scripture for those themes -i can switch from c to g to e minor chord on the guitar smoothly !
i heard much about their desperate struggle to get it to work w/ the tv *how hard is it ?
instead it was a democracy .
it 's basically the same ... ..
with numbers outside of square rooted numbers .
*four hours later* here i am now ... .
and then after that we headed downstairs for some ps2 .
hmm ... .
do n't piss off your friends =p .
well there were 7 of us including me today playing against one another , and lucky me ...
who knows ... .
it 's too good to be true .
grrrr !
* programming last day on working on project ... .
after last run we all went home .
apparently the counselor that helped me re-dedicate ... ...
and then me mitch and hammond jacked some drinks n stuff for the ride home lol .
and we went to galleria .
ever heard of diplomats ?
with uwo students out on a retreat there were n't many of us .
yup ... .
that means no science or bio = ) , but instead the long , boring torture of double period w/ ms. manson *history then civics ... .
i just hope i do n't flunk it .
so i went up there and talked about my experiences at tc ( refer to my flashback blog ) and it actually was n't that hard .
and lunchtime is still around 2pm in my head .
oh well , the last three were basically about denial though .
last week was one of the most hectic weeks ever , and today started off so nice and easy .
your choice of songs kinda runs dry after a while ... ...
the other 5/6 were good ... ...
sports doctor ?
what else .
your day seems sooo much longer .
that was basically it ... .
well connie sure knew how to get a group of teens to pay attention .
no .
in the end though we lost ... ..
but then ... ... ...
left behind is still a awesome book .
tastes like a cadbury chocolate egg liquified .
and the salad was pretty good too .
thing , yup it 's still fresh in my mind .
joe ... .
18 stickers were stuck to my back , which led me to retaliate by failing to punch gavin and dave lol .
they 'll be @ the charity ball @ uwo maybe , or w/e other universities have .
improv ? ?
but minus twenty-five is damn cold .
75 years ?
1/28/04 all exams done ! ... ...
well in the end we would all agree *since i made a huge debate on this lol* that spiritual fruits lead to spiritual gifts , and spiritual gifts lead to spiritual fruits .
well we originally payed for an hour , but would be extended when two of their comps froze with bf 1942 .
watched finding forrester .
who cares ! ?
yeah i know i sped by today ... ..
tonight just getting closer with one another with many games and just chillin ' with people .
today we just learned about basically the canadian and american convoys going to britain lost lots of boats .
so yeah ... ... .
in the end though the team me and calvin had won , as our one player roy was really fast , and probably took more rebounds than me lol .
well ... .
so after that time of just screwing around , they had to leave , but me calvin gavin josh and dan were already in our room so yeah ... ..
when it 's been in a book that 's been sitting in my room for over 10 years ... .
yes ?
yes i do n't feel as bad as this morning in history !
homework , working out , hype , usual i guess .
still got ta do some devos for today .
like to a news reporter , this thing is the jackpot .
5/31/04 aaah ... ..
forgot king street 's blocked off ... .
i can write !
programming class ... ... ...
or `` why did we put forth only 60 % instead of 100 % of our time into this ? ''
i guess i 'll be switching between odb and purpose driven for a bit .
i woulda been woken up by the constant sniffling .
finished that ... ..
i did n't realize there was a competition but in that case ... ... ..
today though we had our first presentation .
they sold it for 50 and i got it for 30 ... .
but seriously my group really sucked .
i mean this verse really applies to my personality , and i 'm really gon na start to try to change myself to act more like the verse tells you to .
ergh ... .
i think that was it .
4/5/04 *yawn* what it 's monday already ?
then he said something about rice and then he somehow came up with `` rice unit '' instead of g-unit .
ate lunch .
best position if by my standards , or power forward .
well my plan to blog earlier yesterday was pretty stupid .
i mean , i love learning about world war ii , since i used to be sorta a 20th century war nut ... ...
but yeah anyways back to the crap dinner .
not much to say on that ... ... .
er review .
reviewed also .
thats long story short at home .
i was gon na do super mario ... .
i sorta wan na get to know other religions better though too .
9 exam in june .
and afterwards , when doing our cheer ... .
yeah jt also announced this is his 3rd last hype meeting .
this morning i woke up early .
with homework n stuff in your way .
but just before i left , i got a call from wendy .
and then after a bit me and john headed back to school for our math test ... ..
saw a lot of people there actually .
it is only msn .
well our gr .
anyways after the lesson , we closed in prayer and then headed to the food table .
now originally me underhill and robert would agree to go to the library after school , but i had stage band x and would meet up with them later .
you hit me .
got another 300 pages to read or so ... ...
i mean ... .
english we got some year end assignment where we have to act out someone from a book we studied in the year , and also we finished watching fried green tomatoes ... .
so for the rest of the time basically for the day , we just had some free time .
oh well ... .
so we got to the church first !
and from the beginning , on , it basically showed what jesus ' went through *a lot of pain and suffering* for the people that rebuked him , but he still loved .
got my exam back .
hmm my shot 's slowly coming back .
really gives you energy .
finally !
seriously what 's so intriguing about a urinal and a jawn ?
another group was a hick group of pure guys and no girls basically *except two* and then the group w/ a choir ... ..
all that took around ...
we have a lab due for wednesday that 's about looking at our front lawn , and then we also watched some lame video .
not saying white people suck or anything ... ..
though it may sound sickening to some people .
not that i do n't like that ... ..
mainly because it did n't work lol .
trying to incorporate a hat in .
well ... ...
no note-taking for 140 minutes in a row !
entry ... ..
last year the gr .
i mean i 'm dead anyways ...
there is also part , but i forgot what it stands for .
not a uh ... ..
so we had a lot of talk revolvin ' around that , and lindy seemed to be pretty interested with our thoughts .
it 's ohl .
somehow ended up at union station and decided to leave for home ( it 's about 7pm already now ) .
oh well anyways now that music 's over ... .
just workin ' out w/ marcello and dan and then some ball on my own since no one seems to be at uwo now since everyone 's gone .
but anyways ... ... .
well originally it was either movie or just chill @ the mall ... ...
then walked home .
we had reverend daniel tjoe-a-long still *by the way in previous entry i think i got name wrong this is real name* and he spoke about how is grace amazing .
we butcher the game so bad it 's not even funny .
i wo n't answer it the 10th time !
well i met jason at his locker , then we went to mine ... .
thank goodness people at central are willing to hold doors ... ..
though apparently all the `` superstars '' are wearing this style .
but i 'm not about to explain that .
wrote notes ... ..
finally see some faces i recognize .
i think that 's my peak for now .
2/10/04 one more week till huntsville !
food .
and also we caught up on what the huntsville kids missed .
i really felt the warmth of god surrounding me at the time also , as when i was praying , i just felt like an inner warmth beginning to take over .
shweet ... .
well so basically baddy from 5-9 ... ...
like usual congratulates me on my achievements in kiwanis ... .
but before the good times ... .
at the moment though ...
* but it 's really funny .
lol that got some laughter .
well ... .
and her charisma reminds me of that motivational speaker we had this year at the beginning in september .
i 've had about 1700 visitors .
after 2nd period bell ... ...
stupid adjudicator did n't know how to disqualify !
gon na be so weird next year not seein ' em in service ... .
well that is something i do try to pray for .
`` i was surprised to see that the guards were not there .
work ?
so while on the road , we talked and stuff , and somehow i managed to stay awake the whole time and we chatted bout a whole bunch of stuff .
but i still buy it every once in a while ...
just a quick sheet about nutrition facts , and then watched some lame 1980 's national geographic video .
do n't asks lol .
my favourite *not .
so i decided to go finish some piano practice .
*eep* .
smurf !
fun lol .
* oh yeah and greek salad i 've never actually known to be this good .
yes and i manage to get all the blame for going nowhere in one and a half hours .
sat around at home , ate , and stuff like that ...
band 2morrow .
the rest of my day .
service today also took a different route ... ..
it 's just kinda funny how i seem to be the only person at times that even knows what she 's talking about .
the movie really sucks personally i think because they leave out so much stuff .
wow ... ... ... ..
* yes i now realize what kendrick meant by sending out a schedule .
it actually did n't go that bad .
wow i sound like a nerd .
i now remember .
apparently thinking can make time go by real quick .
there were tensions built up .
this is why i have an 80 in math =p .
best movie i 've seen probably .
not much else to say really .
and then ... ... .
pastor mackness said that it 's almost like the song `` amazing grace , '' which talks of christ even saving a wretch like the composer .
i got more sleep ... ...
i started `` planning '' to go to masonville w/ caitlin , rebecca , sarah , lindsay , and well ... ..
and this year we actually managed to get past 2nd round ... ..
it was like 8 mins of hardcore toprock ... .
science ... ... .
got to ucc around ... ..
i 'm getting better at it =p .
he owned me lol .
was go to the course selection assembly .
little girl : did you see the sky ?
after doing that ... .
least my marks are decent ...
this is going to haunt him for a while ... .
and for rest of the day we did these trigonometry problems .
i woke up like usual , fairly tired since the night before i was doing stupid but `` productive '' things like reading other blogs , surfing the net , and just letting tc memories whiz by my head while i was thinking about how much more exciting this year 's tc will be since i 'm determined to go to both of the days .
the grounds all muddy and squishy from lack of roots holding ground together , so yeah when water falls the soils all loose and muddy ... .
do n't remember much else .
usually i do n't like normality of my days ... .
this is actually pretty cool how these last few days seem to go so well ... ...
so today ... ..
bused ... ..
mature people do n't always accept things more maturely .
so anyways after a brief chat , headed down to cinema 10 to see shrek 2 ...
then aftera word of closing prayer , and talkin to the others ... .
they made it from 99 to -2 ) and struggling on the snow-covered 401 ... ..
geez that company 's been unstoppable this year ... ..
by looking through the crappy books we were provided with ...
11 nyc trip , which i am looking forward to .
i 've had good naps in class lately ^_^ .
then why do n't we respect those who pass away like this everyday ?
so yeah that was basically my lazy day .
originally i did remember them earlier ... .
and then went back to the house and we headed out for the bus stop .
but all this seems to have been set up perfectly .
gah the sun is n't even out yet !
took up some h/w and now to english .
we were on our way to the church to pick songs and practice for sunday morning .
yeah dissecting is fun .
i mean it was really weird .
anyways for the two movies ... .
finished romeo and juliet .
well s'all good ... ..
for our fellowship ! ?
*few hours later* yup , after a stomach-upsetting dinner , and a lift where i was drinkin ' some tea to wake me up ... .
dinner : basically ate at richmond court then went home .
snare , tom , floor tom , and bass .
damnit !
first off since we did n't start right away , me and jason were locked in a `` fast '' paced game of chess .
and played ps2 .
anyways ... .
me and arthur started sessionin outside ( breakdancing ) and yeah he 's not that bad for breakin ' less than a year .
i mean ... .
and the sun seemed to shine outside then .
we got an extra day to work on our project ... .
and especially what we were doing today ... .
i mean , no waking up at 730 , and today i got to wake up at 8 ^_^ .
war angel ... ..
i think he probably lost over $ 100 in value in the end .
we won obviously .
but yeah steph seemed to have a cool week back in london too w/ her dad .
yet .
yup ... ... .
gonan probably go drum and then ucc .
dinner was n't that great ... .
which i would be very happy with = ) .
ugh my mind 's functions are slowly detereorating from school mode now .
i can do no work in gr .
after programming i 'd see all these signs pinned up all over the school begging 9ers and 10 's to sell their semi tickets to gr 12 's .
3/3/04 tiring days make joe ... ... .
10 math ... ...
lol funny as hell to watch .
and apparently some people even now are still trying to hunt down the nazi veterans .
well jason asked if i was gon na play ball .
that 's not an issue .
lunch =p .
today though ... ...
stupid smurf .
and blogging .
badminton never fails =p .
waaaaah toronto !
i was outside w/ reception and for some reason i could n't call anyone .
meh why not ?
and my reply was that like job got what he originally had , and god gave him a surplus as like a thank you gift sorta , or like a reward .
time to head to history .
beat him in 21 though =p .
but yeah we did n't really do much today except review .
but yeah that was pretty much my day i guess .
me and jason died while back lol .
only first 25 minutes though ... ..
was gon na go out for lunch ... .
first thing i do for long weekend : head 2 head games lol .
english : we did these stupid fgt questions .
adrian would mass lings , jason would do most of the work , and sauron ran to my base since he kinda got obliviated 10 minutes into the game .
well i ended up putting down an order for a samsung 17 '' lcd ... .
it 's cool though .
basically planned out hype for may and june ... .
well anyways so he decided to punch me 8 times or so ... .
hmm ... .
yeah that was history .
and i hope it comes through again .
all that happens is we get interrogated about our book , and then sit down and she writes down a mark .
we only play for one school for half an hour , then have one and a half days to screw around and do w/e we want .
it 's around 2am and this stupid website seems to think in eastern time zone it 's only 10pm .
wow ... ... ..
whoo .
not everyday you see a kid go to school in a checker limo .
why could n't i have more kiwanis classes ?
i was still trying to shake off my morning slumber , as the ride to church was pretty tiring .
hammond left around 5ish and i started to do more intense studying .
different names though =p .
took notes ... ... ..
could n't imagine what life would be like if it were like that lol .
at first this did n't look like a great situation for talking ... .
we 'd finish doing rehearsal around 630 ... .
oh yeah and zavitz got these killer pair of shoes .
nick said he 's bringing his modded x-box .
fresh off the uh ... ... .
* so yeah ... ..
* apparently lots of central students still go to william 's though ... .
lates people .
and then got ready to go to wendy 's for hype tonight .
po-kan and derek cason sitting beside us even heard us .
ugh this week has been filled with many ups and downs , but i 'm just happy right now that my week is over and a new one is about to start around the corner = ) .
but he says he 'll `` consider . ''
shoam !
the marks say so .
coffee ^_^ .
take a break .
crap on 103.9 ...
then again i ai n't goin for singles just because i hate doing all the work .
it 's basically an exam ...
that 's 1.5 today .
not much else to talk about for my after school life ... ..
it 's about remembering that christ died for our sins , and rose 3 days later , conquering death and giving us eternal life .
well it seemed easy at least ... .
the teacher *in the video* was teaching about nazi germany , and was talking about how hitler murdered 10,000,000 people basically right under the german people 's noses .
well i think i got a taste of that this morning .
took cherryhill today w/ dan and elaina .
so yeah worked on that ...
basically all lighting is fine right now ... ..
yeah i bet half of you do n't get it ... .
well a session that we 'd eventually not do because we were waaay to tired after the workout we had .
lunch today went out like usual .
ergh got ta start homework soon though .
then we thought `` hey why not get a cell out here ? ''
that 'll be basically the whole movie in its original form .
grr ... ... ...
lol so many jokes popped up from this .
the plays today were hilarious .
all of them were pretty funny .
stage band x today ... ..
except science and music i wish exam week was longer sometimes ... .
so packed up my stuff and went home .
well in the end i did n't finish everything , so i just did what i could and then off to biology class .
eventually i ended up sitting home ... .
talked to some other people a bit and laughed at the beginner snowboarders .
played songs and stuff .
cramming rules haha ...
i mean obviously they kinda made the americans look `` good '' even though they were getting their butts kicked ... .
lots of advertising for semi ... .
pretty below-average class .
hammond , thompson , mitch and some other people : it 's just funny how you talk in chinese then throw in an english word lots of people : yeah ! ...
eventually it got boring , which led to a talk that me , wendy , dan , sarah , and calvin had about how may camp seemed a bit lame at times .
leafs just lost and sens took series to game 7 !
so we went to mcdonald 's today .
this one is a bit weird .
however though this would lead me to a really weird thought later on ...
it 's actually not that hard ... .
well for some reason i recall doing that ...
weather test .
and i 'm actually starting to enjoy it .
in the end what josh would say is almost exactly what i was trying to bring up .
ca n't really recall anything else happening today .
yeah but then found out it was 5:50 ... ..
i wo n't ruin any of it though , so you go find out yourself .
wth ?
got home ... .
after school no sessionin today .
as i can barely stay awake first period each day now ...
it all began today with waking up from an 11 hour slumber .
well originally my original posted blog was around 6 or so ... .
as of right now ... ... .
banting managed a silver .
basically we just learned more stuff to help us pass when the exam comes in may ... ..
after fixing that *i think* and whooping some ass on nfsu , balling time !
p. diddy 's `` come w/ me ? ''
well the crews eliminated did get bumper stickers lol .
i wan na learn how to do graphics design , html and still have exams to study for .
well after doing all that stuff i 'm now officially realizing i need to spend more time playing my piano and less time doing other things .
i could n't really finish mine , but it was amazing .
*this morning* morning did n't really start until 10:30am .
shakespeare by now is very disturbing .
up until now ... .
probably only asian girl i 've ever seen surpass the 5 ' 4 mark haha .
some people stopped by and watched .
i also stayed back to work on much needed to be worked on theory .
we just got past the part where he gets eaten by the giant fish ... .
rice and snowpeas w/ beef ... ...
er `` army . ''
not much else happened ... ...
now i know why stomach acid does n't burn through your esophagus when you vomit ...
that all took about 1:30 minutes .
he spoke a lot about his spiritual life , and how he spent nearly $ 30 million of his own money on this film .
got ta finish a few things then sleep .
then the rest of hype starts to laugh too lol ... ..
i figured out the co-ordinates of the actual pac-man and he figured out how to make it move .
teacher : that 's my point .
ooook ... ...
so we ate for a bit , then headed upstairs for some free time and then our first bible study , were we met our youth co-ordinator ( s ) : lindy and thea .
3/11/04 and after almost two and a half months blogging ...
and we are in top 10 !
brittany lockhart was right by the window on main floor and no reception sadly haha .
and i hope that mike did alright also .
after a long waited week ... ..
t ... ..
abba , elohim , jehovah , the list goes on and on .
today we had to look at the reproductive system and excratory system mostly .
anyways , got home , played some sc , then went to mcguiness landing , and dropping off marcello 's b-day present and saying happy birthday .
2/6/04 basement jam 2004 ... ..
got my exam mark !
it was pretty fun .
programming started late because of this law test mr. cox was giving out to gr .
yay .
patrick came around at about 7:45 and we headed out the door for school around 7:50 .
nick and me were pretty confuzzled .
mom forgot dress shoes .
we got there real late lol .
anyways the bell rang ... ...
so yeah as you can tell , today my neighbour got married ... .
and i got a history exam wow ... ..
oh yeah ryan 's back from suspension also *anti-semetic material on his site* but he was still kicked off comps lol .
it was really boring though .
picked up jason around hmm ... ..
really cool stuff .
argh .
where we are learning taxonomy and finishing up the respiratory system .
well i 'm out for the night .
too good to be random .
school has n't been to great lately .
i just practiced music and then studied .
12 grads this year , which i actually never knew about lol .
*shudder* the thing i hate most about any music .
well one thing was it was wednesday , which means my day lasts from 6am ( gr 10 band ) until 9pm ( theory class ) .
he 'll guide you through the right path .
as this is why i am beginning to improve my prayers and increase the time spent on devos .
maybe .
josh is decent at db , and gavin and i blitzed a lot near the end on d. at the house we were at *i forgot who 's but thanks for allowing over 30 people in there* we watched superbowl on projector , and had 8 pizzas .
we make a peep and she 'd walk over and stare at you and the people around you for 20 minutes .
never thought rebecca could pull a burn like that lol .
we sounded good ... ... ...
hope it 's gon na be somewhat amusing .
keep on growin ' in christ kids .
i think the title of the sermon was `` when the lord reigns ... .
other than that it was usual sc , h/w , and msn .
so happy i only got two marks off ^_^ .
has ashley judd , samuel l. jackson , and some other person in it .
i woke up around my usual 6:30 for a wednesday .
guess having a geo teacher that once worked @ yuk yuk 's really pays off .
the money that pentagon uses ( which by the way they can use as much as they want ) they could probably give americans free health-care .
except the people that saw it happen .
those things ... .
not bad ... ...
watched some videos from the 50 's about socializing .
after reviewing a bit of pdl ...
then ... ... .
but all in all ... .
* only hard part about my part is i have to play really low notes .
though i did n't get to go on them i did go off the new backbone ramp , where i bailed and also off one of the ramps .
eventually though i 'd still end up playing a bit more ball when i headed to ucc ... .
k maybe not but eventually ... ... ... ... ...
star trek ! ?
and that was pretty much it .
* john : geez chill ... ... ...
dunno if the others have thought of this theory yet .
i 'm off to sleep ... ..
* civics : we started debates today .
meh anyways before much else happened ... .
t-shirt was good enough for today =p .
wonder what i 'll do .
you get hit and fumble the ball .
and found out that jaclyn jung 's sis seems to be one of those typical asians who likes really high marks .
but since he pmsed , and attacked london , his landing never came .
i was grouped up w/ dan and wendy , and like the other groups we talked for a bit before praying .
i honestly think i 've become 15 too quickly .
whoo playing test today .
i really think that god is doing something with this fellowship , which i truly praise him for .
and then we read more of romeo and juliet .
-civics : bombed my exam *i think sadly* -lunch : went to jasper 's .
actually wait ... ..
lunch headed out to jasper 's today .
she actually knew transformers theme lmao that was classic hahahaha .
com ) sorta .
as one of the weirdest things ever came up .
so we ended up walking an extra ... ..
i have a really big test tomorrow and so yeah two hours of solid studying *plus msn , winamp , and other crap* but solid studying .
oh yeah on another note ... ... .
looks easy enough ... .
pisses me off when i fail to complete somethin ' .
but yeah ... .
it was pretty cool though ... ... .
now that that 's outta my system ... .
now by the time i got into math class i was an icecube .
but once we heard lucas got gold ... .
still got church service to head to tomorrow ... .
i 'm not exactly selling it for myself , i 'm just d/l em for my own musical appreciation .
and math ... .
and the plywood was never used .
apparently my eyes are bout the same ... .
hot chocolate ... ... ... .
got my careers presentation over with ...
i 'm really tired ... .
got there a bit late ... .
( dun dun dun ) .
steph : joe remember counseling requires listening .
yup ... ... ...
why does trig look so dumb ?
yeeeeah it was a good aroma lol .
whoo hoo ... ... .
plus today we took the van .
after much studying and hard work ... ... ..
i really need to start working on the project , which me and robert did after school .
well by now it 's around 8 ... .
but then again ...
we ended w/ a closing prayer ...
you know those people ... ...
music class we learned more about music history ... .
and i had to go to theory .
well my uncle *who 's name is john also* was already there when me and thompson went up there .
so from that one line the speaker charlie was speaking about how missionaries should be witnesses all the time anywhere .
managed to finish a thing or two ... ..
started off with a bit of singin ' led by steph ... ...
some of the songs werer crazy .
and while i 'm at it play nfl street ... .
brandon dropped it ... .
this is why you : never buy cheap duffel bags from some bag store in the eatons centre when they have their closing day sale and sell you a bag for 20 bucks !
mostly chairs we borrowed for bbq .
so many jokes made tonight though lol .
ugh i hate exams ... ..
but yeah off to badminton now ...
hammond finally actually asked if we could go to his place and the answer : no .
worse than 20 's or 30 's i think .
well the library actually lots of stuff happened .
hopin ' to see it on friday when i go over haha .
all the songs are so crappy ...
umm session by the end was n't too bad .
so my day started around 1030 this morning ... ...
come to think about it i shoulda just missed the bus and walked lol .
chatted a lot , and then badminton started w/ calvin and gavin .
hinting that i 'm late .
well it was now that my questions were answered .
somehow scott got 19.5/20 though we had the exact same report almost ... .
okanski ran to his place to grab the project portion he had and came back ... .
you know a song 's gon na be a hit single when it 's a song about nitrogen .
now i 'm sitting at home ... .
thank goodness he has message history lol .
but ... ..
so after eating sometin , i then went to practice some piano before going to my lesson , along with talkin ' to jason about playin ' ball at ucc today .
lindsay , me hammond and dave were a group .
hmm ... ..
so ate one of those ... ...
so i waited around in that coffee shop in sears for a bit ...
mmmm ... ..
1/29/04 whoo !
and jumbled up with stuff .
making the most of what i can with march break , and sleep is always one element that ca n't be removed .
so we got our stuff , and apparently my name tag had almost been taken by someone else by accident .
basically americans had a total loss ...
and i 'll talk about university when i 'm in university .
mr. mccumber seems to be pretty peeved about anyone that makes a peep in class *other than instruments .
slow moving morning i found .
from 5-7 pure working out .
played piano , chatted , and now blogging .
basically he told us of how to be completely honest w/ god ... .
they 'll own them =p .
* it was pretty funny ...
well i forgot which team won ... ..
was n't too exciting of a class ... ...
big pupils+my stupidity in math class=debatable stonedness .
deep fried wrap w/ chili and stuff and you serve it with sour cream or salsa ?
so he kinda sniped and actually took cover n stuff .
last year i still remember ... .
2/21/04 the aftermath of fatigue from huntsville ... ..
since i barely studied .
we almost did n't get it because some retard *cough nikki* almost blew it by telling the teacher we should have another piece .
so basically for the whole time we snowboarded ... .
he has n't got mad in two days .
2/9/04 bah ... .
oh yeah also arjun and shaunvir said something about london youth symphony orchestra ...
10 band ... ..
plus volunteer work/basketball/usual stuff i do in summer .
*joe and josh just look at each other amazed at gavin 's stupidity* josh : yes gavin ... .
swiss mushroom melt burger w/ fries and tropicana jiuce ... ... ...
i bused back home ... ..
this is now why `` i hate mcdonald 's '' quoted from teefy lol .
i saw the evil grin of mr. curphey .
this really did n't work .
like rotating .
it was about one of my friends .
maisie mad props for helpin ' me with math today lol .
*shudder .
jason was the most hyper one out of all of us like usual ... ...
teacher not doing job ?
uhh ... .
my booklet i got from tc looks like a collage of graphite .
finished it in about 30 minutes and then chatted for a bit with dylan and boughton and some other people .
hmm since i had to wait for bus , i read a bit of purpose driven life while waiting .
no sc or anything ...
he missed the kick ? !
meh ... .
hope you enjoyed this long entry , and did n't find it too hard to learn to use your internet browser more than you already know=p .
usually comedy/ real life experiences really get my attention in sermons .
oh yeah then the dreaded `` step as many people on 16 or so blocks as possible and whoever gets the most wins . ''
usually dissections for schools do n't have juices coming out of it .
plus a coffee all for just $ 6.38 !
were we actually that annoying though back then i wonder ?
anyways ... ...
well we got there around 630 .
while going home though , i stopped by the new pizza hut where western donuts used to be .
lina and yang were there today also .
yup ... .
i 'm stuck w/ ms. manson in the same room for almost 3 hours .
then sleep .
coulda got two seconds = @ !
yes signs of year end is approaching with textbook checks and test dropping .
they have a survey to see what music should be played at one time .
well he left first ... .
well this could be a motivation ... .
argh ... ...
well like usual i went to church .
no stupid stuff though most of us were pretty tired still from the morning wakey-upey .
yes i can draw pac man now lol .
anyways yeah that was most of history class .
so excited ... .
or the vector joke *jason , gavin , calvin we can all clearly remember that right lol* and of course the `` i 'm the white larry bird '' joke from family guy .
i wanted to sleep ...
i awoke this morning to the sound of cheesy radio music emitting from the radio downstairs .
the whole lack of sleep thing , lots of work ...
yeah my steam was n't totally blown away yet ...
and then service started .
especially english .
booooorrriiinnnnnggggg .
woke up at 730 this morning for school .
yeah everyone made fun of him lol .
bought some new clothes from winners *whoo* and then did h/w .
*i wish , to both of those claims .
he makes any serious video game seem like a retarted comedy lol .
same here !
plus oakridge and westminister really sucked beyond the boundary lines .
everything else basically goes in a pile for burning =p .
well almost .
this was me and josh 's interpretation : the women who cried risen !
not !
1-on-1 i got owned ...
i actually did n't use extra time for once .
but softer ... ... ..
not .
but instead of thinking about that ... ... ..
dinner was good .
it 's hard to describe ... ..
bah !
so boring ... ..
so now ... ... .
and i can only see things more than two feet away from me .
but i had some of the most peculiar dreams ever .
also on a side note ... ..
yay no mr. mccumber !
hehe today i also realized that god had always made time for me to do devos ... ...
realized two things while on bus : 1 ) bus drivers in london are much more polite than toronto drivers 2 ) reading pdl seems so much easier on a bus than at home i do n't see how ... ...
i feel pretty comfortable public speaking now too ... ..
and picked up the guitar and amp .
so today during service being half blind was n't too bad .
lol me w/ nick 's glasses makes me look like a fob lmao .
sarcasm .
but before that hammond comes up to me with a carton of eggs .
today started off like usual ... .
god is good !
she 'd put up her cheesy overheads , and then do a useless task of finding jot notes when she gave us the answers at the end anyways .
i dunno why but i 've always been fascinated with dreams .
that would have meant probably another 1,500,000 men defending the beaches of d-day alone , and probably anoter 3,000,000 could have helped in russia .
that was the solo .
5/30/04 blargh ...
i 'm still somehow amused by the movie ...
over history though *on my note* humans have been straying futher and further away from christ .
never do it in the rain .
blargh .
he started it .
so until my next entry ... ...
yeah i 'm really excited right now .
so by the time i got home i was starving .
* it was ok @ school .
biiiig house .
and the team sucks so bad that they would lose more often with the goalie in the net than if they did n't even have a goalie .
oh yeah thompson got a coffee too .
and we got some review q 's to help us .
mornin ' went by quickly , as before i knew it , it was already 12:30 , and i had to rush to my piano lesson .
but yah that was basically it .
rome was n't built in one day as they say =p .
then i made a siege tank raid .
left house @ 845 .
this was my first blog with the new title format !
so hehe ... .
yeah that basically summarizes my day .
making a theme park for the digestive system ?
like today ... .
visually seeing it ... ..
though there still are some parts i do n't get in vesuvius and do not go gentle into that good night , but i 'll figure that out in time =p .
it was a 24 pound loaf so paul 's and pat 's family did n't really finish the whole thing .
incredible .
i need a better comp ... .
music class today ... .
wow ... ...
hmmmmmmm ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ..
yes my eye is now swollen from yesterday when i got nailed into a wall ... ...
tiebreaker '' but it never happened = ) .
well woke up at around 7:20 , and left by 7:40 .
anyways off to history ...
countdown just finishes , everyone 's downstairs either sober or half-drunk ... .
thompson was having the biggest embarrasment .
it was cool though being able to lead the first praise night .
well this morning ... ..
i 've been 400km+away from london having a blast !
below zero , it `` snows . ''
soul calibur ii= hilarious game lol .
plus i have n't bboyed in a while now ... .
it was typical sunday i guess + some other things occuring ... .
no i did n't cry , or feel very different like `` oooh i 'm gon na re-commit my life now , '' but it was very interesting to see what another fellow christian brother pictured in his mind when he read about the last 12 hours of christ 's life .
really weird book and i do n't see why it 's considered an `` amazing '' book .
while packing the project , almost broke adam 's esopha-drop , but other than that it was good = ) .
i 'm tired ... ..
i still do n't understand why they even did this raid ...
a new approach to my blog ... ..
oh boy tomorrow 's gon na be a long day too .
and rushed to school .
now do n't get me wrong if you 're some sax person at central ... .
and instead ate and just bolted out the door for school .
it was actually a joke test .
then after rec came tc media .
there were 7 steps .
but least she made the effort to come .
or not ?
-bio ... .
and i have come to realize that contac-c is fairly useful in times like these .
they just had to add that to the movie even though it happened almost 4 months later .
then came hom around 9pm , and started studying for math .
it 's paid off !
god once again has forgiven me ... ..
that just shows how much media affects us and how lazy i am not to have read my bible .
so yeah i really did like today 's sermon .
oh yeah and also my sock was turning sorta red from blood but meh .
no action ... ...
11 next year .
i just hope that those two things mean something to the people i 'm writin ' to .
yay no more school for a duration of many hours !
aww crap .
meh ... ...
hope it 's up and running by june or so .
his intelligence has officially hit rock bottom lol .
it was pretty funny .
and it 's in 3rd person thank goodness .
romeo and juliet ... ...
it was also cool to see that by the time sermon was over ... ..
cya .
so after that high energy worship , we came to the message , which was spoken by pastor kirk bartha of waterloo mennonite brethren church .
i do n't know if i 'll even share it with her .
think i saw over 15 or 20 people there that i knew .
sorta ... .
basically it was a huge game of interceptions and maad plays .
time to open a can of whoop ass !
i guess it did worry me a bit ... ... .
yes i was late like usual .
i spent my time doing programming project .
so josh , rebecca , steph , if this seems a bit harsh , well it 's true .
so yeah before worship ...
well least science does n't start until 12 .
yeah signs of the year end is approaching everywhere ...
* it 's kinda cool though how realistic programming has got over the years ... ..
so yeah ...
linked two !
some of these wars ... ...
now we pretend the exam is over ... .
bummer .
best chicken pie i 've had in my life .
looked at sites afteri finished my hyperstudio project .
are those chords like `` asus '' or the dreaded b , bm 's , bsus or ... ..
i coulda easily got 3 ... .
average .
doubled .
well dad went to do grandma 's house , while i sat on our driveway clearing the ice off .
`` ugly ! ''
and then i forgot how this ever came about but yeah me and gavin started to break down the saying `` your face on a grill on a bigger bigger grill '' in ways like this : joe : your face on a grill on a bigger bigger grill !
then blood comes down .
yeah we watched that ...
pretty cool though ... .
it really is getting tempting to go .
which really caught my attention ^_^ .
well at least for me it did ... .
and about how he basically reclaimed stuff from bandits .
plus constructive criticism for nothing .
brescia came too ...
and how no matter which way you go ... ..
soooo unforgettable hahahaha .
or whatever grade she 's in .
well i would then leave w/ mike and dan ...
but yeah pretty good time ... ..
not much to say ... ..
uhh ... ... ..
yeah that 's right .
he had a dad that beat him and he did n't have many friends , though he did have high marks in school .
woke up @ 6am and ate ... .
i 'm basically paying for cancer .
actually lina said she wanted to start reading the bible ... ..
4/28/04 school ?
wow ... ...
i 'll just waste a pair of wet socks ... .
thought it was pretty interesting ... .
other reps i did n't really pay attention to , but yeah i think they did a good job with their speech .
oi this morning felt so weird when i woke up .
played some ps2 , ate food , compy , and stuff .
where eventually we cancelled and john ended up getting a java for no reason ... .
end of uwo school year is so close ... ... ..
basically the teacher then makes everyone think they are a cult called `` the wave '' and has a whole system of society .
i managed a 96 !
discussed the sleepover mostly for friday and hype .
after i finished setting up the stuff i went upstairs also , but by the time i got there it was basically over .
actually it was kinda fun .
but was awoken by a phone call at 7am ?
crap !
hopefully i win .
got a few things done ... ... ..
it was pretty enjoyable .
programming : almost done my 007 animation !
right now it 's raining ... .
i 'm now officially the bass trombonist for one song in senior band .
but yeah i decided to wake up early for once .
really hope rest of hype will be more involved next time though ...
more action hahaha .
so yeah i was happy ... .
now time for math .
i actually got some stuff done .
grr that lessens my chance of getting my trip to pizza hut though .
and tried a mediocre attempt at crickets .
hmm ... .
and today we learned about elections .
my mom n ' dad pays their taxes for me to learn history in history and english in english ... ..
not bad .
is n't that bad i guess .
well after that grueling hour , it was time for ... ... ...
i will never think the same of a heart again *ugh .
hahaha finlan 's stuck w/ giles .
some other dude decided to suggest for moga this year ( most outrageous group activity ) we should try to set a record by making the world 's biggest human parabola ( mathematical thing u know , looks like a bell ... .
even last year ... ..
well it was interesting .
l-unit .
it made hk look like a rural area .
so yeah ... ..
i learned too much from mohaa when me and paul played it at his house over lan lol .
not that it 's bad but i guess many of us are somewhat quiet , so she prays for us now basically and that 's it .
and that was it .
so yeah after losing my bag , i went to workshop somewhat unprepared now since i lost all my stuff lol .
ur cut .
jason was desperately trying to fly a plane with a keyboard .
at church though jason brought his inflatable samurai sword ... .
other than the fact we all decided to kick out finlan and have him sit on the defect seats lol .
forgot what it 's called though but it looks cool .
well after a stupid talk about how stock markets work ... ...
* but yeah after that we picked up jason , and amazingly ... ..
then quickly washed my hair to get bedhead out ... .
me , thompson , hermann and nate went to mcd 's .
yeah that 's basically it lol .
talked bout yesterday 's superbowl game mostly .
which by the way never happened .
it defeats the purpose of religion i find .
it 's like time puts on nos boosters whenever i do something fun .
rcm 6 ... .
all these sub teachers are really boring .
you know did the usual announcing my piece , then started playing ... ..
this project is actually pretty retarded ... .
afterwards i headed straight to wlac for gym night tonight for our english ministry .
we lost lol .
2/13/04 gon na miss semi= ( ...
jason was already slowly dozin ' , gavin was readin his tc booklet , and josh i 'm not sure of because he sat in front of me .
chatted w/ ryan on the bus ride home , then got home around ... ... ..
had some really good games nearing the end , but at beginning ... .
i was vice prez both times ... .
surprisingly , doing all this blogging has made me come to like public speaking now also .
so i woke up , quickly ate , and ran out the door .
he related how sometimes a member of the church may sometimes cause some hardships with the pastor .
played sc , then started imaging .
gavin skooled josh in singles .
well in the end he ran to jason 's base ... ...
but before that ... .
so we started the script ... ..
2/27/04 a relaxing friday after a stressed out week ... ... ..
i ended up getting a ps/2 remote and a 7 foot long extension cable for my ps2 controller .
every party ... ... .
apparently our class `` pathetically '' failed the first civics test , even though most of us had decent marks .
oh yeah and when victor was chasing me around ready to kick the crap outta me ... ... .
central got gold ... .
has been filled with tc talk .
i was starving and raided da fridge where i would find chicken fingers ... ... .
* anyways ... ..
zing .
i guess i sort of feel the same sometimes ... ..
o m g i 'm horrible now .
this year has got to be the worst/weirdest one ever .
got home , ate , went on compy for a bit then slept until 6pm where then i had to get up for music night ...
ps2 ... ...
and then this was the part where i taught the girls how to say what 's up and they kinda butchered it ... ...
done =p ... ..
but it can be pretty boring there ... .
arjun was there too ... .

5/18/04 pig dissection day !
this is gon na be full length , uncut , unrated , un ... .
right now im still like i dunno 10 inches away from doing it .
good times good times hahaha .
but i seriously ca n't remember half the shit we did through this year .
which was n't bad .
i just hope the assignment i helped her on will be alright ... .
dan came over after school ... ... ..
apparently jason 's dad can make it *he 's a chef too* but his mom is n't that great at it ... ..
really the trombone/baritone section ... .
i feel bad for her though .
but then all the more spiffy look ended when it hit his shoes .
i never knew that snowboards worked as well as it did today with candle wax .
1/26/04 a day of relaxing ... .
that 's most of it .
i heard that there is a course fair thing on wednesday .
a hippie .
no wait what 's gullable mean ?
but got a few funny ones .
pretty quiet class today actually .
what else ?
and just havin a blast w/ some friends ... ...
what a waste of time .
i witnessed that today .
so after doing all that , i pick up my bag , and head for the car .
getting so tired of fast food .
after a week like that it 'd seem like there is no such thing as school .
while ushering i started to be amused by stupid things *like usual* and started to have a staring contest w/ a christmas ball .
gavin n ' dave are exploring the twisted world of silent hill 3 lol .
not much excitement there .
daniel trinh and gerty are related ! ?
after service though ... .
so basically all those days of starving @ lunch have paid off .
very much like home ... .
then headed back to school .
but yeah they kinda went through presentation a bit fast ... ..
we eventually played almost an hour later *i ate more* and we played until 6 where then i had to leave for my eye doctor appointment .
but no we still rehearsed .
walked in thinking it 's a 20 minute test and lo and behold ... ...
so i ran up there and i was right .
apparently some of them were surprised when john told them we were 15 .
more of a carb substitute they force you to bake .
yeah unfortunately i could n't go to the party tonight because i had to go out for a family dinner ... ..
whoo !
so yeah ...
too bad i have band ... .
it 's so stupid .
with 4 days of kiwanis , badminton , catching up on history+civics , and a whole potpourri of other things ... .
if i get less than 5 hours of sleep , i do n't go to school .
saw paul there ... .
after head 2 head got home .
yeah real smart there cam .
hammond did n't really help at all though probably caused more chaos than good lol .
so i was n't really complaining .
then at mcd 's we started throwing our cheeseburger wrappers *we had a lot of cheeseburgers* and then we almost got kicked out ... ..
and lo and behold their in the gym !
hilarious band .
she had an awesome message though .
phht music history ... ..
mmm tea ... .
except without the blood since the heart has n't been in a organism for months probably ... ..
our game stopped when pastor mackness stopped us for the fellowship to officially commence .
me and john gon na probably be central doubles team a .

and if four prophets could n't get it through my head and all of a sudden a hollywood can ...
well now i rush to my bustop ...
well last week .
she left us with a few final words , and we gave her our emails ... .
i lost to josh when he played one handed .
mmmmmmmm ... ... ... ... ...
what trip could be better than that ?
what a great use for such a cheap substance .
i mean ... ... ..
had some pretty funny talk there during practice though hehe .
me and nick can play better than him .
icy killing po-kan. hermann overlooking the raging battle between the helpless po-kan clinging onto dear life and icy 's merciless attitude towards him .
in fact it was good experience to learn how to do a praise night and how to improve it .
well anyways enough of that ... ... .
we got back to our rooms around ... ...
for lunch ... ...
dunno bout steph or gavin .
loud and clear ... .
i think that this radio station will help in encouraging people to start attending church .
yeah a good one hour .
headed out to school then ... .

hmm ...
and then announcements came ... ..
and apparently i bubbled in my bday wrong .
so yup ... .
and it even shows in bible..
then gavin and dave , going even more mentally retarted , start to sing 99 bottles of beer on the wall .
english : cafe thing got scrapped for today since no one brought food .
wow so much happened there .
i 'm out for this blog entry .
showed us that going to church is to praise the lord , not to mack hehe .
paying 40 bux for the two objects just so i do n't have to ever walk up to the system ( except for changing the cd but still ... ..

they both go with anything lol .
oh yeah rhoden sang the element song since mr. curphey got pissed off at him .
then again ... ... ..
and for lunch .
mcd 's hot chocolates are no good ... .
but i can still manage hehe .
and so much can happen in your sleep too .
leafs game ?
summarizing today 's kiwanis in one word : crap .
but why did the canucks lose .
hehe i clearly live out the phrase `` rise w/ the sun . ''
least no h/w ^_^ programming was usual .
hmm ... .
right now my list of things to do is somethin ' around this area : -theory -math project -bio lab -piano practice yup ... ..
* these are the times when i wish tc lasted the whole week .
praise team singing practice tomorrow .
but oh well things came up ... .
well first thing a lot of us did was watch christian play pac-man ... .
later .
i mean i was signed up to play basically just godzilla eats las vegas ... ..
oh well anyways to the subject ... ..
hehe was pretty cool , and i 'm slowly building up my badminton friendship hierachy .
i 'm gon na try starving this whole week , since i 'm trying to save up as much $ $ $ as possible for tc .
instead of the stereotypical voice in the air , they used an actress *rosalina something forgot her last name* and poised her as a bald , eyebrowless satan .
i am the lord . ''
subed up to fairview and had dinner there .
ugh makes me feel late lol .
they 're all dead , and their corpses are probably gone ... .
we had to say a verb or adjective and an animal and then our name .
and this is now where i have dinner .
originally i was gon na go work out with marcello but he 's still kinda sick so i just decided to nap instead .
that 's why i 'm looking forward to senior music next year .
one main one was about a dream i had a while back which i mentioned in one blog ... .
so yeah now i 'm home ... ..
i mean at the beginning of the day i was somewhat tired , and the day did start off slow .
we walked back since she did n't exactly have a bike also .
but that 'll be in one week 's time .
now time for programming ... ..
wow ... .
amazing defense but crummy offence .
wow .
also i like to try to keep fit ... ...
i do n't see how they can prolong the end of the world that long .
headed for home .
surfed net mostly today .
deja vu 's always freak me out .
i really hope that one day more people at my church will see that a church is n't just a building to enter on a sunday ... .
i mean i feel god 's there , but it is n't like a happy feeling .
before i told him we had only been there for only 30 minutes .
except this week instead of gr .
afterwards today no sunday school !
a guy kills another guy with a pacemacker jammer making it look like the guy 's pacemacker failed .
started listening to the same cd i was listening to last night and doing my devos .
the kiwanis festival has once again pulled me out of class and killed 4/5 of my schoolday , since today was also early dismissal .
well i enjoyed the day at least =p .
least they made it .
i guess it 's kinda weird how i barely even know the person , but not until like a week ago did i even know she 's in gr .
so ...
but william 's does have its good stuff ... ..
anyways yeah i guess i 'm goin on sc for a bit , then headin for the the hay and more dreams .
then : bf1942 .
unless i totally bomb the exam tomorrow which i think wo n't be an option ... ... .
eventually we both died lol .
so yeah now i 'm at home bloggin ' , typical blog endin ' for me .
first class of today ... ... .
it 's kinda stupid i still find how in the end they just had to add the bombing in japan-occupied china ... .
well i just woke up from a 3 hour nap *naw did n't do anything in the end w/ colin and paul* and after a shower and dinner trudged downstairs to work on my science lab when then i find myself in a huge group convo with the following message : `` everyone put an x @ da beginnin of ur name to pay respect to cecillia zhang whos body was found in a missisauga ravine earlier yesterday morning .
hype was pretty good today .
i 'm still boggled by how jenn manages to sleep so little and not get sick ...
er to dave 's house , i say to and not into as i could n't fit in with 5 duffel bags .
yeah you have to be in my class to laugh at that ... ..
and between the two of em they had 5 inteceptions in less than 3 minutes .
lindsay and em are over at sarah l 's right now ... ... ...
plus two cans of pop lol .
apparently there is something lower than applied math !
now i go watch some avalanche game ... .
bland also well today ... ...
so yeah not very appealing but meh ... .
badminton today was decent i guess .
he said he re-dedicated over 3 times in his life already , and that it is hard to keep up a good christian life .
it did make sense in the end .
though i 'm still sniffling from post-sawdust syndrome ... ... .
and then for the fight scene the music we got was uhh ... ... ..
`` famous '' group of babies which i never heard of .
well he as a programmer ... .
*sigh* i thought only my family still did that lol .
whoa ! ! ! !
but she play singles since banting badminton blows .
all jokes though hehe .
lunch ... ..
and so i headed out to church then .
i figured from there *do n't ask how* that it was the physics room ... ..
all old skool lol .
i pull out my gargantuan clock that i brought in for time , and set out my writing utensils and stuff and then prepared to write my exam ... .
amazing !
but though this is supposed to be a normal blog , it 's gon na be somehwat short because i really want to sleep .
beginning at 8am with badminton and not ending until later after a game of sc probably lol .
little england ... .
really i coulda finished just that ... ...
also i decided i 'd stay an extra 2 hours and get a ride from alan back to london .
do i have to say more ?
so after that i then started to listen to my music for ... ... .
hendrick mayde 70 yard bombs ... .
later people= )
while going there we almost forgot to pick up jason lol .
so that kinda sucked ... .
lots of nfl street lol .
and then ... .
we get to watch saving private ryan next ...
well today 's message was about `` pressing onward toward the goal , '' which if i did n't hear wrong the goal being heaven .
the gov't put him into a juvie program that forced him 4000 miles away from community and they had to climb the rockies .
of course after morning routine .
we are doing world war two ... .
well after they kicked us outta webstation ... ...
meh .
and i just hope the advice i gave her was really from christ himself .
i guess easy street since james was new to snowboarding .
bummer i have an upset stomach lol .
nothing big .
there .
the stuff he has done in the world for you .
that was history class for you .
well dinner sucked though .
game crashed !
he does n't know what he 's doing sometimes it seems lol .
it was the first time i watched the show and the last time as it being an actual functioning show .
eventually i abandoned his project and then i went on my own task .
other than that ... ...
too many to count .
ammmmmaaaazzzziiiinnnnnngggg .
went home then to eat and then headed out for senior band which i 've talked about already .
i finally see gold at kiwanis with senior band !
and proceeded with the rest of my day = ) .
besides ...
watching hammond suffer on the ski slopes was awesome !
not like mr. clark cares ... .
then we left for acf snow football and superbowl party ! ^_^ .
3 's over ...
and this little ball of something was rolling around on the ground ... .
photoshop 's actually very user friendly as later i would find out though .
* yeah it was nice to have a day of eating ... .
* well today 's drive to school was n't that bad .
we lost = ( but s'all good we still got candy !
saddening i know .
i wan na set up a video blog for myself .
and choir ... ... ..
since rebecca reminded me i had english homework today ... ..
that 's basically what we did for an hour , then played ps2 , compy , and then headed to badminton ... .
none of us can even try to get the thoughts of the great times we 've had this year .
i had a crap game .
anyways after that , gave john a lift back , then i went home and immediately went for some sleep .
history bein ' pretty boring ... .
cookies were good though so good start calvin haha .
the english teacher is pretty funny .
well after a quick 40 minutes or so with him teaching ... .
shweetness = ) .
was gon na meet up @ boler w/ marcello n ' scott but guess not now .
well i 'm stuck with doing him ... .
mike had a sunburn so smacked him across the back after he nearly pushed me into a garbage can ... ..
and now for the rest of my day .
busing home then ... ..
well after that ... ... ..
well i thought at least .
clarence : guess so .
and they managed to still get a silver !
so i woke up aorund 850 , and we met up at galleria around 930ish .
marchment gets a puck off his skate and past belfour .
why could n't it have been a positive thing !
plus talkin ' to jenn , lina , dan , carmen and some other people on msn .
but thankfully the doorbell woke him up so off to church we went .
i really suck now at badminton lol .
we have to make food chains for next day that somehow relate to us ( we eat beef , beef comes from cows , cows eat grass ) .
piano , devos , maybe a bit more sc .
but yeah got to school perfectly on time ... .
which i still need to get cracking on .
please ... ... ...
on my time bag the strap was still intact , but the ring for the strap broke .
lucky i made a deal with parents to be back by 8 or they are paying me $ $ $ lol .
i said while he was at it why does n't he dot the i 's w/ hearts n stuff .
yeah the movie 's just as twisted as the book ... .
so yeah that was the one big first thing that hit me .
i talked to some other people about what i should do ... ..
but yeah there were a few funny jokes she told ... ... .
but yeah sorry people .
whoa out of normality there oh no !
so we did usual ushering , and then headed in for praise and worship section of the service .
and in the quotes of ada : `` i bid the farewell . ''
but i do n't have any popsicle sticks to make the gargantuan structures that i have planned .
what happened was while going to fill up gas @ a station , she parks on the right side when our gas tank is on the left .
plus my mom thought she heard me talking to myself in my sleep .
`` weirded out '' in quotes from strong bad .
well that kinda got changed to ucc , piano ... ... ..
wow lucky i did n't wear k-swiss shoes today woulda been ruined ... ..
amazing !
10 when next year comes .
surprisingly it was easier than drawing the face .
i 'll just add some finishing touches on it sometime .
it was so sick .
today i stayed in school at lunch ... ...
today we finally hit some actual action .
i can see why playing basketball in the gym can be popular now .
anyways point is ... .
-do we go to church to admire the building or admire god ?
then today was communion , so we went upstairs .
er more like old school .
jason also came to lunch today , and after eating we all just walked back to school .
1/16/04 a day of many accomplishments ...
ugh my eyes are killin ' me though now ... .
just playing and stuff .
church 's annual may camp retreat .
is nothing on the menu ?
anyways after stable power was back , i played a bit of rollercoaster tycoon for some reason , and then some sc where i whooped some ass along w/ jason and some other random people on bnet .
he got people to chip in opinions about each one ... .
and i was surprised with what liam had to say ... .
not bad for only 4 months .
so here 's the summary of my day : -woke up -hygeine crap -ate -ran out door -went to school -music found out i have a new music teacher -science : sucked like usual ... ..
i think it was another dream about our church in the future .
kinda embarassed myself when i tried to clap w/ karen 's feet lol .
least i 'm doin good at it =p .
mrs. mitsis is going to kill me soon lol .
and for some reason fred and christian were talking about ... ...
so basically our school killed ourselves .
plus we had b-day cake for wendy .
well for me anyways .
yet high schoolers still got ta suffer for two months *shakes fist .
yes i did forget what time it was at .
and the last performance w/ dave rutt 's ( one of the stage band x conductors ) band .
i was surprised to see that ashton kutcher can actually be serious though .
plus chattin ' w/ jenn on msn right now .
it happened .
by the time i got home it was about 6:30 .
my arms are beat now .
dissed by his own country 's citizen on a worldwide video .
1/2/04 exhaustion at it 's max ... ..
this is the one and only unique ... ... ...
and yeah now i 'm home bloggin .
i washed dishes afterwards .
*yawn .
that 's good ... ... ..
off to science .
that 's my rendition of it at least ... .
it 's cool too though ... ..
* oh yeah got course verification forms today also .
so yeah ... ..
but nooooo she seems to think starting an argument with me about how i was wrong and dumber than a rock and how she was right seemed to be more efficient than moving the car to the left to avoid retarded stereotypes and make ourselves look stupid .
and that is give us new life .
and then headed into history class after chatting with pourier about yesterday 's kiwanis ... .
apparently this time he got 2nd ... .
lunch ... ... ..
however i did n't have time to really do anything with my hair so i ended up going to church hoping my hat would squish my hair down .
you know an oreo .
shaunvir 's tryin ' out also , and arjun 's going for trumpet .
but i just had no will to eat today .
but im refreshed now .
oh yes , driving in a freight truck , realizing you are as tall as a house ... ..
only thing i actually did for the whole volleyball game that was good lol .
well today we had a lab ... ..
something to look forward to i guess hehe .
so yeah now i have a new duffel bag =p .
whoo .
this is why ...
yeah i think i should probably start doing my devos soon ... ..
hmm ... ... ..
pretty funny .
it was n't too bad of a sermon .
coffee was really good today .
it actually makes sense .
before once again being ... ... ..
*hhhhuuuuuh ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
wonder what happened to make it plummet from 95 cents to 67 ... .
for some reason she parked near the end of the lot when there was a space right beside the store ... .
though walt disney sorta figured out the world is a small world ... .
i tried to name a few in my head ... ..
also i really hope that our church can really help with this station in establishing a solid foundation .
but when someone 's squirting litres of blood ... .
hahaha at least i 'll be living more than 2 blocks away from him ... .
i 'd first like to congratulate my neighbour scott yaeck on gettin ' married .
then ms. young-kipp was ranting about how we really need a gym floor .
oh yeah almost forgot about that .
and like usual the rest of the class would add to the excitment with `` oooh 's '' and `` whoa 's '' whenever po-kan was getting his ass kicked .
was gon na play ddr but not enough time ... .
oh yeah me and calvin nailed our double planche move too today lol .
whoo .
tomorrow i got ta wake up early once again for day 2 , and i really want to go to it this year lol .
11 more day 1 's and 11 more day 2 's and school 's over .
i dived on that , ate a lot of it , but was still hungry .
and long-time-no-updaters are jason , gavin and josh .
finlan , lindsay , sarah , rebecca , ginnie , and the list goes on .
by the way if you find most my blog revolving around my car ride ... ..
there has n't been one person that has n't laughed at that video ... .
hope that gets better soon .
well i had coffee and fries w/ gravy .
four ! ?
hopefully i can upload em one of these days ...
very loud .
hope you got whatever you need because this is gon na be one long blog .
first comes pythagorean theorem , then some crap about triangle theorems , and now this ... ...
loud .
and ... ... ... .
sho sthupahd !
and i guess 2nd game they picked up the pace a bit so 11-7 .
hype sleepover was awesome !
hope we win something .
so yeah ... ... ... .
wow i should be a movie commentator.^_^ .
and did homework .
well we learned about the dionne quintuplets ... ...
and i was actually awake for much of it .
actually wait .
average assembly day 1 !
well when i got back to school ... ...
wake me up at 730am ... .
i was surprised .
i dunno why , but i just do n't like stuff like sammi or twins .
school stress seems to lessen and lessen more .
just the fact that i got to perform an inscision on an organ ... ... .
the excitement .
one of the 70 dollar reebok ones .
only thing i 'm missing is a phone headset and a coffee machine .
i 've been pretty amused with my new 4-piece setup lately .
the movie pearl harbour actually was pretty accurate .
so i quickly ate ... .
so yeah our car ride to toronto .
i think god was there for u for that moment to really help us .
great pieces , and if you wan na hear us play vesuvius ... .
but yeah we had him for a teacher today , and then miss .
basically just chillin ' .
not history in english ... .
then off to ucc .
nope .
smart=p .
john thompson !
talking ...
seems so short now when i think about it .
so continuing from `` like i said ...
there were only 3/5 trombone people , and most of our clarinets were non-existent .
so listened to her story , and then afterwards pastor d went on with his sermon after carmen read scripture .
robert : i think so ... ...
maybe it was n't such a good idea huh jason =p .
bio class melissa 's group went today for seminars .
though i 'm mostly totally out of the bubble they have , there were a few things we could relate to .
who cares about ... ..
creativity points right there .
it was really weird we all went hysterical after that .
was missing carmen , and the twins mike n ' dan .
whoever has inside lane .
now it 's around 7:15am .
here i am blogging about my day ... .
which then led me to throwing my duffel bag at lina and punching josh .
than our hype counselor ali !
it was actually a really good movie .
finished it in the 1st ten minutes ... ... .
i walked up to the piano .
first i was kinda surprised to see the strings in our usual rehearsal room , but also when i actually stepped into the strings room for band rehearsal ... ..
i 'll sing behind my noise bunker maybe lol^_^ .
a crapload .
well today i woke up at usual time .
but anyways back to the going to movie thing and how i think we 'd be the first ones to arrive ... ..
i was surprised that students actually showed respect during the anthem .
back to the subject .
it really raises the bar for me in being a follower of christ , as sumair could suffer through so much and still be so devoted .
and also another battle coming up next ...
math class consisted of approx .
wonder if there 's a way to shorten it .
i mean right now two weeks ago was tc 2004 , and i ca n't believe that in a matter of say ...
honestly if you 're gon na diss someone with a crap diss like that ... ..
we went to the computer lab and rotted there for 75 minutes , looking up stuff about the holocaust .
yup ... .
yup ... ..
* had a big discussion on it , what surprised us , what the movie meant , etc .
later .
well i also bought some food from the cafe at the library .
pretty nice bible though .
and of course the universal food that goes with anything ... ..
it was now bio class .
josh and i would have to leave with brian kung as the hype councellors and the `` admin worker '' *me* and whatever josh 's position name was *we agreed on `` relations rep right ? ?
it would 've made me feel guilty that it takes a human to show me how much jesus suffered ... .
so i 'm out for the night .
thompson got a pretty nice meal today for only 4.75 .
trigonometry 's up next .
so yeah i 've been havin ' pretty bad luck w/ duffel bags last few days .
me and gavin had lightsaber wars *mature huh* w/ wooden sticks and recorded gavin karate kicking a already broken cinderblock lol .
since exam started at 830 , i woke up around 7:40 .
like we have n't really been talking .
ok. what ?
lol gangstas with the poorest command of english i 've seen in my life lol .
yeah well though i probably do n't know most of your mothers , but it is mother 's day , so therefore ... .
once again ... .
well anyways yeah after that i got home .
stage band x : we are improving !
science class ... .
fooooood .
we made a decent run for 8th seeded team i guess .
using stupid hyperstudio .
well i woke up around 730 ... .
woke up , got ready , and headed to pat 's house for a ride to school .
and so after okanski and underhill leaving first , robert played some ddr for the first time in his life ... .
easy breeze class like usual .
so yeah pretty much everyone thought was pretty good movie .
well maybe for 97 it was .
yup once again i 'm headed to the ucc for more badminton .
but hang tight people ... ...
we learned about different names that god has had throughout history ... ..
when someone in your class has a 98 average in bio *wo n't mention names* and still panicks about this test ... .
what a biter lol .
then at 1230 i left for piano lessons .
and for myself ... ... ...
weather unit never got through my head .
anyways ...
by now i think you all know what my morning routine is ... .
past mediocre but below ging ah !
final run through for stage band x as tonight we perform .
* well actually do n't mind history ...
i would then take over his comp and start to play bf w/ jason .
soooo good .
i find it amusing , and just sometimes when i 'm bored i do sometimes read back on what i did say on ... ...
9 out of 9 possible awards for schools were all silvers !
elaina ca n't really figure out how to read without laughing , and lilian kills literature reading w/ a monotonous voice .
me and robert draw the `` bodies '' of tybalt and mercutio .
and headed out to downtown .
and it was blinding .
and yeah picture taking was funny lol .
not the best beginning , but things would hit a climax when i got my cell phone lol .
final meals , and i did n't really like it lol .
almost late but not quite =p .
vel ... ..
but then again mr. d was n't even playing defense , and finlan was struggling to keep up with the gym teacher since patrick is a gimpy .
-english : finished in-class assignment , kurtis still had his football gag going .
and then basically got ready for hype .
those were some of the main things that happened .
as we were walking in ... ..
and you both will be in my mind forever ... .
woke up at 10am , and then started to practice piano right away .
john was driving full steam into me with a jeep ... .
yup thought i 'd scrap the whole `` focus on number crunching ! ''
getting there , we played some one on one , shot around , and then the full court games started so we had to shoot when they were on the other end of court .
i feel special , the whole `` yay i got burned by a good crew ! ''
let 's whoop some ass =p .
ate ... ... .
choir *shudder* and some other ensembles ... .
true crime can be kinda fun when you 're bored lol .
he 'll get pokan in trouble ... ...
plus salad , and etc etc .
yeah prayed about that plus the other dream which i have never mentioned and still wo n't .
i 'm very intelligent .
the whole neurology thing/psychology thing ... ..
at least go up to them and say it .
now we were supposed to leave at asap ... .
more of `` joe let 's mark your theory ... .
lol .
i mean singing is supposed to be a `` punishment . ''
well here 's the summary of my day : like usual i wake up , do all the wake up crap , and head to school .
and i saw my account jump from 281.99 to 651.99 .
2/29/04 leap year day blog !
least supposedly we do n't have to `` worry '' about wmd 's hitting our borders anymore .
they seemed pretty bitchy .
so yeah that was basically how it happened lol .
pretty fun though ... ...
i started from making detailed drawings and full sentence answers to chicken scratches and broken english .
mike and hermann were pussies and would n't go out into the cold .
sleeping from 4am-2pm sure kicks ass ... ... ... ... .
reminded me of telnet back in ctg *cheesy text game* days .
and pourier got another detention for throwing paper lol .
i quickly headed to the music room to savour what practice time i could for my trombone solo , and then studied the wee bit before the test we had today .
and liam for example of a different letter was `` lazy leemer liam . ''
now back to followin ' the avs after their long break from defeatin ' the stars .
out ...
because i did n't know what the heck i was doing for the whole time while making presentation .
* and now my guitar chord span is up to 6 !
* 7:30am : joe wakes up to another brightly illuminated day .
and i was so close to making quarters .
yes ... ...
i 'm just wondering what i 'm doing though this weekend ... ...
i drummed for an hour then watched tv .
i 'm surprised that she wrote a entry on jan. 13 , 2002 about us .
lucky i had 11 hours of sleep yesterday .
now if i can i 'll try to go watch rockets-lakers game .
it all had to start w/ the first letter of our name .
never really thought of that play on words ... ..
anyways left school..
the glory of seeing total black driveway .
a very legitimate excuse for not blogging yesterday .
lol .
now personally i thought we 'd win ... ... ..
that all faded away ... ..
i mean during the school weeks , it was sometimes a bore at night ... .
and off to home ... .
ugh all the running ... ..
lates !
i 'm done 5 papers almost now !
reading , got 66 % on exam , and 76 % on animal farm test .
but who cares point is it was fun =p .
lunch we went to jasper 's .
christ gave us the boldness and courage to go out and preach to the world about the wonders that god has done for us .
argh !
but honestly sometimes it seems like a show more than worship when people start turning into a mosh pit at times .
good old gabe lol .
it was so weird though .
but it was cool though , sarah made some pretty cool remarks , which i guess in a way makes me have a different outlook on her .
like usual ... ...
ugh boring as usual .
and some other crap .
i did n't like it lol .
later .
no i would rather not sit back there w/ fags and losers like you .
and doing absolutely nothing .
oh yes i remember now .
wonder if the games are over yet ?
yeah it 's a lot to intake .
why did n't i go with heather and nate to mcd 's i do n't know ... .
at first mr. richardson came into the room and i was thinkin `` yes no mr .
feels like it 's friggin ' 1am .
right gavin ?
yes apparently badminton was on the roster this year = ) .
fag .
so far at least .
ate ... ..
hmm ... ...
but it was alright i still managed to wake up on time .
eventually he made a demented heart ... .
i was surprised of how even a 4 year old can be so hyper .
final runover went fairly well .
so if i had kiwanis bling ... .
he 's really been experiencing so much .
then again who does n't do that hehe .
so sat a round there until 5:15 ... .
of course there are always the memories that re-occur every year .
wait no it was n't .
all that money can do just waaay to much than can be mentioned .
wow was it good .
by the way hyperstudio makes microsoft actually look appealing .
so our game kinda bombed .
retard .
sumair answered some of the questions asked last day about christianity and about god .
10 people .
then at the end of 4th , for some reason over 40 kids were called down to the office ... ..
the session had a hefty bit of people show up .
things to do now .
how our math class could n't ever factor x+1 ... ..
but yeah i was sorta thinkin `` wow i just told you that joke from mitch . ''
did some pre planning for next saturday lol since it takes us friggin forever to plan sometin .
the steak instantly reminded me , josh and gavin about ju pah ... ..
oh yeah and i took down a whole note ... .
and of course ... ... .
unless i could all of a sudden pull flares in one night which i really doubt .
today we learned that the song `` son of a gambolier '' is actually the georgia tech theme song or something like that .
anyways after that ... .
i think i 've heard that tune before ... .
and class was over .
it 's like putting a sports play into action and working 100 % smoothly .
zzzzzzzzzzzz ... ..
it 's a bargain for the quality food i get there .
and i 'm beginning to like taking pictures with a d-cam lol .
oh yeah i started to practice clutching with a dasani waterbottle in a cup holder .
wow ... ..
i think not .
thursday that 's right so no band lol .
apparently he did break his arm in the accident but he looks healthy .
lucky most of the exams on that ^_^ .
piano lesson : i need to work on scales/technique more ... .
since i woke up @ 11am i missed most of the day .
least not wet so no chance of athlete 's foot ... .
travis ... .
today ... .
well after another 45 minutes we arrived at ncac .
did n't do much but i should catch up soon .
i 've been around the house eating etc .
ow but it feels so weird now ... .
it 's kinda nice to have mcd 's every once in a while though i guess .
sooo cool .
funny though lol .
but the point is ... ... .
8 and 9 piano in one year .
i actually do n't get nervous public speaking anymore ... ...
he had h/w .
came civics ...
whoo ! ! ! ! ! ! !
some other kid *rui-ming by name i think * was surprised how fast i got to that stop .
also that stacie orrico person or sometin apparently is a christian artist .
then we had to answer a few questions out loud ... .
history class is norally this amusing .
lol ... .
chatted a bit too ... ..
obviously not forever i mean seriously my long term memory is n't even good enough to remember that `` but how the heck can i remember the times tables ? ''
yeah weird but guess he skipped school for badminton spectating .
all rory played were a crapload of powerchords* and also courtney rosso 's dance gig .
first game we played : we played central 2 ...
bio class today ... ... ..
after that business as usual .
the only reason why i 'd even like the month is because it marks the fact there 's only two more months of school .
that 's less than the amount i said .
and i got ta study for civics ... .
i dunno wat the heck the teacher 's federation thinks of or whatever da hell made the movie .
that 's pretty much it .
lots of them !
not all the rooms ... ..
er 310-surf .
actually in fact i thought we may lose a game or two ... ..
well i would call gavin , and he would call josh , and then we 'd put the phones up together and make it sound like josh and gavin called each other .
so much has happened ... ..
like the one of how her husband joined a car club and to her they just `` stand around '' in parking lots friday nights lol .
and of course practicing music .
well me , thompson , hermann , nate and mike *white one not chan* went out to galleria .
oh yeah and the line that my last group had ... .
careers ... ...
4/24/04 so much for adjusting back to normal life ...
her sis is good at music though so i 'm assuming the same for her .
mainly cuz her class is pretty boring and i zone out a lot .
at first i was gon na get subway but then switched to bk .
dan is a friggin tank .
the thing was out of 20 .
last year was somewhat exciting sometimes with mr. rice as a geo teacher .
decided not to blind anyone with the flash from camera today hehe .
later .
turing is getting pretty funny with graphics .
crap got ta get lina for hype lol .
gon na eat then run over trombone songs .
i did n't really know how to play so i was horrible @ d but i was decent on offense .
very creative haha .
got home and went straight to bed .
i for myself , found it somewhat interesting hearing the biased thoughts of many intellectual humans speaking out against various things like coca-cola , the war in iraq , corporate capitalism and many other issues .
apparently was his first time in kiwanis .
even though it was n't exactly like the usual theatre thing *no ddr or anything afterwards* it was still an amazing time with hype .
i was surprised he was there .
and also random .
project handed in ... .
but yeah i remember her from the talent show .
and first day of `` what are you reading '' book reports .
so i had fries and coffee ... ..
hmm always thought of myself as a pc dude *somewhat capitalist , figure that people should n't abuse welfare system , etc .
and so the game began with us whooping them ... ..
i 'm at 1640 almost right now .
i ca n't even remember key bible verses ... .
not too stressful at all .
well like usual we played and played .
not being in competition badminton for a year ... ..
too bad he never really accepted christ .
i just found that out today =p .
calvin i guess he 's pretty relaxed bout this ... ..
we had our good beginning run but then was abruptly shut down by sta ... .
lol it was good though ... ..
it 's pretty cool to know how there 's someone always there for you ... .
and we played a good hour or two of road hockey .
did n't have coffee to amuse me till i left cuz i decided to buy one then .
106.9 i never liked ...
so until tomorrow 's blog ... ..
he 's right at my doorstep waiting .
so now i know i do have the ability to do them .
wow ... ..
so ate , got dressed , usual morning stuff and then off to school i went .
utter sweetness ! ! !
this is the first time in the whole year that i had an assembly on day 1 .
so off to lunch .
to me , if you have congregational peace , chances are you also have personal peace .
i beat the first ladder .
nothing too exciting there ... ..
and of course some good old sc .
only around 5 bucks =p .
yeah it made me think .
unfortunately there was one question i never studied ... .
i 'll be bloggin ' more tomorrow ... .
some of them i did n't get at all ... ...
i came home and played one of the longest games ever on sc with jason .
blasted flames lost tonight , which makes the series tied 1-1 now which kinda sucks .
really just chatted 'bout stuff with some people , and our group was trying to brainstorm what we 'd do for a heritage minute .
lots of us were freaked by the demon lurking in the forest that just popped out at judas .
who cares ?
hype schedule ... .
3/23/04 biology presentation went decent ... .
run through before real thing hehe=p .
well we talked about it for a bit afterwards , but i guess it was somewhat forgotten ... ..
but lots of style and freezes .
and i 'm rambling ... .
tonight we had ... ..
shakespeare literature is very disturbing sometimes .
that was just one of the many things that actually happened today ... .
god already showed me so much this week .
where today we would head to the library to do research ... .
something i 've been hoping to avoid all year .
very exciting ^_^ .
my afternoon : very boring .
but yah pretty funny ... .
frapuchinos ^_^ .
i mean in both cases i get food , and have fun .
funny name hoe lol .
which was really good .
yay it 's a day 1 .
that was like a diff version of twister .
it was like last year 's basically .
i said green not bright green jenn !
j/k 96 % is actually the best mark i 've got on anything in math this year ... .
and it 's sens game shawn ... .
after that class ... ...
then headed home .
yeah you guessed it ... ...
* also kendrick suggested i read proverbs 24:17-18 , and i really suggest it for everyone who is competitive and likes to rub victories in other people 's faces .
oh well i still have until late april to figure it out ... .
we had our usual stuff ... ..
oh yeah really weird ... .
my driving is startin ' to sorta come back though which is a good thing , but got ta guarantee those finishes .
and god provided .
which i thought would be a quiz .
i actually did n't know he still payed for himself afterwards lol .
lucky i was re-united w/ it afterwards since matt actually took it since he thought i forgot it .
grr .
ugh so boring .
just very hyper .
mom could n't figure out that my food was still cold so i wasted 10 minutes just trying to microwave it .
it 's a good sign though .
and only 2nd time playing .
except we were on the empty bus .
english we started our exam guiding ... ..
got to school like usual , and hammond apparently set up everything for the weekend .
well i guess i did have some quiet time w/ me and christ .
other than movie night was awesome !
i pulled off crickets fairly well and a decent elbow freeze .
* so it was another day where i wake up at a ridiculously early time *630am* to head to senior band .
but i think it was worth it now .
but then i thought about global warming ... .
oh yeah calvin 's now officially refreshments co-ordinator hahaha .
calculators make life very easy = ) .
did n't do much .
single-tasking ?
no wonder why they are n't famous in north america .
woke up , ate , picked up jason , and we are well on our way to church .
funny one but it is a job hehe .
less things to hit ... .
today was pretty exciting though in ways ... .
yeah that 's about the extent of `` joe 's no life '' goes : being a poser of an alcoholic =p .
but it 's for the church that we are doing this , and i sorta sometimes feel taht we should n't be bashing on other people when you volunteered to do this .
senior music night .
the sharks ?
msn 's constant *doo doo doo* or something like that .
* the workshop i thought was really well done , and the speaker for our workshop who was also a pastor ( christine lee ) was pretty funny .
oakridge sucked , and strathroy was n't that good either .
eew .
well headed downstairs then and ate , then headed out the door .
but yeah so far my march break has been ... ... ...
later .
later .
first time in my whole high school life where my locker actually looked full .
the dude quickly made a few announcements *the organizer* and then ... .
just a bunch of average joes getting silver .
and also when we started talking about old children tv programming ... ...
or peanut butter paintballs .
8 o clock .
poor dude lol .
sorta ... .
sorta .
oh yeah and then rebecca reminded me ... ... .
i got 3rd ... .
now he has no excuse and he still does n't break .
so ate a meal of tofu , beef , and rice and downed it with a glass of milk *wonder what it all looks like mixed with gastric juices in my stomach =p* and then headed upstairs to brush teeth n ' stuff , get dressed , then head out the door .
hopin ' though that more people would come next time ... .
normally we sit in the back , struggling to see what the hecks going on with the heads of gr .
you 'll be mesmerized by what happens .
well some `` shmuckette '' decided to complain about it cuz she is n't `` athletic . ''
and now i got ta work on the rest of my stupid hyperstudio project .
wow and after watching some of the all star game *where the west beat east* and washing the dishes from yesterday having people over ... ... .
saliva lab .
managed to play a singles game with him .
school then home .
especially about the one in the 60 's that had a childhood in legbraces *think her name was wilma or sometin* and in the end she was the 100m champion in the olympics .
oh yeah and apparently mrs. mitsis told that helen person to look for me at school because she needs help on latin prelude ... .
in fact some people are actually worse than finlan .
hmm ... ... .
that actually takes a lot of willpower .
does n't wan na overload the school 's hard drives .
and the one day i decide to wear my adidas tracksuit ... ...
well for a pd day it was well spent ... ... ..
no more of some retired saunders teacher called mr. roxburgh .
however ... .
so after a grueling 1 hour band rehearsal ... ..
last night was the first night i actually got 7 hours of sleep !
but buses ? !
then when mr. baldwin was looking around ... ..
i really would like to see a christian station up playing modern music .
mmm ... .
oh yeah and i did something really stupid : i cut up some photocopied music by accident =p .
i made a remark , but it was a crappy one .
i got decent sleep though ... ... .
his name was derek , and apparently goes to saunders .
my head was hurting at the time .
4/20/04 1/3 of my teams made it in ... ..
so all in all i was n't really complaining .
bused home with dan and elaina , and then walked home through the tracks and got home around ... ..
oh yeah and something kinda funny happened today in programming .
but when you think about it ... ..
hey that 's my usual eating time =p .
hmm ... ... .
slow moving , and everything .
and another part everyone was laughing too .
whoo .
and i got ... .
whoo .
so after waiting around until 3pm , with some badminton , and guitar playing , finally we got home .
meh .
whoo .
so yeah watched that ... .
talked to ryan on bus ride home .
who the heck would wear a armani suit with nike walking shoes ?
i mean ... .
well after the little missions presentation we got from a group of missionaries , hype had their own little meeting about tc .
thats the biggie .
rec presentation for top teams .
but yeah i really do thank god for looking over us this whole time .
since it wakes me up for piano also .
ergh pretty tired right now though ...
but yeah s'all good ... .
rallied a bit with john ... ..
we had lots of chips ... ..
signed up ... ..
so yeah did that and then went to wendy 's ... ..
pizza .
weird thought the kid was n't comin but yeah came home and he was hoggin ' my comp w/ subspace .
1/15/04 slow start ...
still having a seem-to-be dimpled smile on my face from winning 2nd .
i mean ... .
we did a lab where we were in the halls and had people run , walk , and crabwalk 30 metres .
and then off to piano lesson .
2/7/04 another joe saturday .
oh yes and i 'm still extremely behind in theory lol .
that was the main title , but i do n't remember the exact words .
and will and steve got burned by i think one of the albino crews *they were split into two since they were 2 man battles .
science : two words .
that meant i had to suffer the boredom of ms. manson 's civics class before the assembly .
wow i 'm horrible lol .
funny hicks operating a mcd on highway always funny .
if pas class is like this next year ... ..
for some reason the stupid projector would switch from rgb to computer input back and forth until josh set it right ... .
so i kinda shifted over to chat w/ jenn for a bit , then gavin and dave .
so we ran through pieces , and then left .
* seriously if finlan tried his hardest and mr. d did , finlan 's fg % would be something like ... ... ...
but valley forge march was actually a decent playing .
i think anyways .
cough . * ... ...
after that we headed down to the ice rink but ice hockey was over ... .
funny how finlan was being humiliated infront of almost 40 gr .
if i wanted spaghetti i woulda made noodles back in our room lol .
well i 'm out for the uh ... ..
i 'd give this day a 7/10 probably ... .
we chatted a bit about few things .
well i almost totally forgot about the acts acronym , and i 'll share it with you guys now : -adoration -confession -thanksgiving -supplication basically it means you start with you know ... .
boring .
really actually day two kicked day one 's butt all the way to ... ... .
gon na practice trombone soon ... ...
i am now officially a bass trombonist =p .
morning went by as any other usual morning , except no senior band today =p .
anyways my day started like a usual day .
we did more debating ... .
i know how difficult it can be to proofread at that time .
it was really hard ... ... ..
oh yeah english exam postponed because of badminton and other various activities =p .
and also ... .
and now i 'm going to zip through the rest of my day as ncaa finals are on now !
so really its saving you trouble .
if it 's an average book ... ... ..
* math class ... ...
graduatin ' so yeah i think it 's either 3rd or 4th last time .
i made 3 huge rejections today ... ... .
it went up almost 150 from before the post ... .
maybe if i have $ $ $ i can buy somethin ' .
we are now officially labeled : defensive team central !
compared the differences and similarities .
and even mr. curphey was surprised .
maybe .
writing away , i start off writing out the words as i tend to forget many of them .
fried green tomatoes at the whistle stop cafe .
i still chose an auxiliary piece though just incase ... .
yeah today has n't been to exciting ... .
he tries to act like he 's pissed ... ...
first thing we had to do was find jason .
kerry who was also on the hockey team scored a hat trick on sarah .
so after we also heard banting got the trophy for a song we played in grade 9 *yes they played a piece that we memorized and got gold on last year ... .
and like i said before i really liked how they portrayed pilate as an actual judge and not a random condemner , i mean he did try to avoid letting christ being crucified since even he found no fault in christ , and also how they emphasized christ still forgiving us even when the romans tortured him , and not cursing .
took down more notes on politics .
poor girl but yeah it was a funny moment .
and just awaiting the time of conference finals ...
all of us agree that the people need to pay much more attention to the kids and us , and also next year some of us may organize this part of may camp .
jap or a ?
was kinda weird .
duuuuuh .
that 's why .
so problem solved .
well i headed out early though , leaving around 6pm ... .
i went to play b-ball at ucc w/ jason lol .
since back then when i was in gr .
have n't really been able to do serious devos for a few nights now .
by the way i am not a goth ... ... .
nor did i understand this teacher 's system of remembering stuff .
yeah i know so many of them ...
well anyways before i went to session , apparently daniel did come to my house lol .
i need a `` l33t '' comp .
then afterwards ... ..
that was good to see .
and my two counselors this year are matt and ada .
anyways ... ...
kinda started prayin ' in my head .
all stored electronically in some database on a comp .
but alfredo pasta is soooo good ...
took me record 15 minutes to finally drag myself outta bed .
have to pick up vince 's guitar and then pick up carmen .
calvin came too .
but apparently josh 's powerpoint ... ... .
it was really fun too .
that took about 40 minutes and after that went upstairs and checked out the place we were at .
one down ...
sight reading .
anyways i got home ... ..
ugh shoulda listened to jason .
no one was late so no singing .
hehe there 's a bit of fun there i guess .
while on the way to school , chatted with patrick , and finished my tea to wake me up in the morning .
tonight 's talent show was much better than last years .
something that does n't require as much work .
on a monday .
not much here either .
in unison around the whole house : wth ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ?
celing staring is very efficient to waste time apparently .
also talked to jeff about some church things .
so i went along too ... ...
maybe it 's just because i 'm a christian , or maybe it 's the same reaction for christians and non-christians..
he had a video from `` les miserables '' showing how the bishop showed grace to jean valjean by forgiving him for stealing from his house , and fought the urge to have him arrested .
rain got so heavy at a time while playing sc that i could n't even see out of my window .
went to galleria .
and there was another movie ... ... .
they had a good lively worship for us , though one of matt 's strings broke on the guitar .
it clearly says in the bible in 1 corinthians 11:29 it says : `` for anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the lord eats and drinks judgment on himself . ''
got ta wake up , do theory , read , finish math , then head to gavin 's tomorrow early hehe .
tired ok , today i 'm really tired so time to summarize again ... ..
marcello saw some chicks that he knew , well `` knew . ''
now we are into lunch .
oh yeah jason 's mom gave me and hammond lai see .
hopefully in one of them we make it .
time really flies when you 're eating ... ..
lunch..
what else happened i do n't know ...
kendrick started kicking brian 's car for some reason lol ... .
so yeah now i 'm home ... ..
i wo n't reveal much of the movie ... ..
i starved for lunch =p .
i think i 'll just rent a few movies maybe have a friend over or sometin and just chill .
i guess one reason is cuz ms. manson ... .
i am supposedly `` good '' at badminton for my age , as one first year ph .
some cheesy poor-graphic animated video about vectors .
but yeah after that ... .
actually if one day i can ...
it 's not like anybody even cares for canadian elections ...
i did n't fall asleep , not too much hard work ... .
but after school life was pretty amusing .
yeah i got ta go finish up some work .
i finally did the shot i 've been trying to do since gr .
then again it is music ... .
lots of it .
the twins never went today but meh .
`` why ? ''
stupid room service !
ms. wiener i think had a bit too much caffein flowing through her system ... .
talked kinda about the same thing .
anywho after that : music class .
but me being the optimistic one ... .
the stupid 4 feet squared of snow on the front of my driveway is still waiting there .
argh ... ..
1/30/04 3 day weekend start !
i ca n't wait until next year = ) ... .
go avalanche !
then went on sc .
or if there 's a french term for `` same subject of dreaming twice in a row ? ''
hmm ...
yeah racism towards forks lol .
whoa look snakes eat mice ... .
ow .
oh well ... .
oh yeah and of course i 'm better ... ...
but sleep took over ... ..
well yeah believe it ... .
studyin ' for exams *sucker* and also met a dude from gym night .
sorta .
ergh so yeah i did look a bit `` poserish and white '' *quoted from dan* and basically was n't the best time of my ddr playing there .
tonight for bedside fellowship , we just chilled .
and their milkshakes are amazing too .
so busing back to school , went to the music room to see when i 'd get my practice log back , and john made a few burns to mrs. wharton lol .
had a bio quiz next period .
mmmm ... ...
today i actually decided to wake up early ... ..
oh yeah and also i made smiley faces on rebecca 's shoes =p .
oh yeah had to buy a new bag since my time magazine one broke lol .
he seems hysterical about it ... .
who cares about badminton when you have food ? !
i got to see disabilities of humans can never get in the way of achieveysments , see melf do decent in kiwanis if not the school , stage band x beat out a senior jazz group , and of course ... ..
mostly kendrick and wendy will handle it *with theresa `` guest-starring '' a few times* and also we talked a lot about the three kids comin ' in from sunday school group in september .
and wake up at ... ...
it was totally rad .
well history we had a game that we played where we had a given income based on 30 's *poor since it was depression '' and we had to figure out a budget .
dan came up too for some ... .
but then crowd control came when we watched `` ten things i hate about you . ''
yeah it was pretty cool .
teacher also said my book 's good .
band ... .
not very smart but it 's all jokes haha .
home !
i feel a lot more relaxed now about tomorrow 's exam .
well after that we headed down to the food court for some lunch .
er jenn 's friend .
well dan and calvin left a bit earlier , but josh stayed back in me and gavin 's room and we chatted for a bit .
took jason home , and ali also .
so me and gavin afterwards branched out from the burn , and yeah that was talk of the town for a bit haha .
`` you made the downbeat half a milisecond early . ''
few jokes like usual ... ...
but yeah i never really realized how much more mature we 've got over the years .
that one sentence would stir up the biggest convo today .
but badminton was that early @ ucc today .
set my stupid clock back for daylight savings time ... .
noooooo way !
he seemed like the mature type .
well geeks are supposed to be good in math *yes i do n't fit in category yet ^_^ .
drag racing a jetta vs. brian 's protoge ... .
if i were a gr .
i mean ...
i just hope that i can keep this goal and that this is n't a `` spiritual high '' aftermath .
dan apparently can actually make a pac-man game while we are all just animating pac-man .
my ass ... .
next year i wo n't look as big of a tourist , even though i already did look like one for a while @ tc when i was carrying around some of my group 's bags and carrying like 3 cameras at times lol .
came announcements and off to second period .
grr ... ...
well a `` city '' in canadian standards , but also just the fact that going to a conference w/ so many other christians ... .
my 3 page blogs have shrunk to 1.5 .
heh the format of this blog kinda changed ... .
played some nfsu , then got a game of sc going w/ age , jason , josh and myself of course .
she kinda was gettin peeved at me not noticing ... ..
yeah underestimated its usefulness lol .
in the end gavin came over for a bit and we played around on ps2 , and watched pirates of the caribbean .
also ... .
john apparently met his heavily-stoning partner ...
did some lab w/ making stuff fall .
took us almost 30 mins to get to school .
at first she was confused at the song ... .
no ?
so we headed into library ... .
and also after gavin 's talk today about how he felt demons and stuff during worship ... ..
well yeah unfortunately i ca n't remember the message extremely well ... ..
and would then lead us into the lesson .
but civics is really a waste of money and time .
but it 's a really good song .
whether you have a question or not , a rough day or smooth , he 's there .
then started practicing trombone .
wish me luck !
parasited everything i could .
well we started ok ...
ergh thursday 's gon na be hell though intermediate band from 3-9 lol .
joe gavin : uhh ... ... ... ...
i now realize why i was in a way happy leaving css ( not the internet lingo but children 's sunday school ) .
thank goodness for system recovery lol ... .
dan , mike , anton , and jonny came to around 7:15ish .
ugh got one hour less sleep 2nite > _ like i said before today my day started at 8am .
when we are on a main road , across from a liquidation store and zehrs supermarket .
and off to stage band x .
he had to head to class ... .
*more silence* *sigh * ms. manson 's sense of humour for you .
so saw a few previews for some movies like a shark tale or something , and some other movies that i do n't really recall since i was making fun of rebecca 's glasses lol .
* on the terrain park .
it led to me listening to it for almost an hour , wondering why the heck i had never listened to this stuff earlier .
piano practiced , ate , msn for a bit .
well we sessioned for a bit before we went to stobie 's , and then igor went back to school to meet w/ steve and me , dan and jason went to the bus stop to bus to my house .
cool hehe .
and i 'm really thankful that kendrick showed me the verse .
i in the end decided to do nhl , since breakdancing needed mpg 's for video clips .
gavin and dan 's rave party joke ...
when you scroll down to the next paragraph !
wednesdays are probably the most hated days in my life .
it looked pretty nice .
now onto programming .
well basically yeah if you have n't seen the movie it 's a decent example of the actual battle ... .
if only we got by them ... .
4/29/04 hype for may-june : all wendy and kendrick lol school may not have been exciting today ... .
well she dyed her hair again ... ...
the dreaded , and most infamous ... ..
did n't see gerty or jenn like we planned *lol crappy planning there* but i did manage to find jason and brian wong .
high school he was basically the school bully , narc dealer and booze hound .
dreams are still something that i 'm always fascinated with .
i guess this film will be pretty epic , with so much to talk about it that they even had a full feature interview with the director , mel .
no i 'm not .
hmm what else happened ... .
but too bad i forgot the form so i 'm ruled out of that by default .
playing ball and stuff .
well the biology note had to get done since i needed to get ms. wiener to photocopy it , so it was kinda default that i had to do it .
but 2nd game ... ...
first game : thursday , april 22nd , colorado @ san jose @ 10pm .
* i actually never been to fast eddie 's before in my life ... .
so i woke up at gruelinf 6am as usual *yeah jenn ( wong ) 6am is brutal , just think i 'm gon na be doin ' this 3 times a week compared to your 5=p* and got ready for school n ' stuff .
my back is now a gigantic ferrero rocher commercial .
they 're perogies !
well after waking up , i went to practice my piano for about ... ..
but instead i 'm stuck on either compy or in front of piano ... ... .
london free press talks a lot more about local stuff , while the globe talks about international .
who cares ?
it 's harder than it sounds ... .
but at the moment it was pretty funny with random stuff like that popping up ... ..
it 's a rave ... .
friday 's always consists of cramming for piano , ucc , and other various activities that seems to kill away my fridays very quickly .
anyways yeah that 's what we did through bio class ... ... .
like how much a mp gets paid ... .
lol it was exactly like an actual 007 movie theme song ... .
*three hours later* here i am blogging once again ...
yes something somewhat out of the ordinary that happened today ... ... .
i 'm always grateful i play the piano lol .
no flaws whatsoever .
yeah i think i 'm gon na sleep early for once ... .
sub teacher *yay !
oh yeah and history buff *me* =p lol .
so today was n't very long ...
i guess his mom was going somewhere .
becca seemed to be neutral throughout the day and yeah gavin was pretty frustruated as josh was bein ' a bit hard on him with some cheap shots of remarks and sarcasm .
point form blog *yay people are going to punch me for this =p* -woke up -senior band ...
we just chilled for a bit before we slept .
hmm the speaker ... .
then one of jason 's old clan members came and we played a 3v4 melee game .
this was when more talking started since people finally got to know one another , and we 've gone through two interactions already .
right now it 's pretty good ... .
hmm for now though ... ..
why do my mornings suck so much ?
blast .
came the retarted .
i know though he did his devos because i saw him do his when i started doing mine .
we got further in 10 minutes today than we would have in 3 hours yesterday .
eventually he went ... .
no singing today .
really fun .
then again i try not to make enemies .
today did n't do much actual playing ... ..
history class today ... ..
talked ... ..
talked to pat since i gave him a lift today .
they just seem so much more out there .
but it was funny ... ...
1980 's animation was horrible lol .
america has never had any success in establishing governments .
also i got a funny pic of lunch time , and also of the dreaded lunch lol .
the videos like usual were really funny , and that pretty much took up the whole class .
life 's been a bit more difficult .
but yeah , do n't know why but for some reason imaging has been kinda amusing these last few days .
with bits and pieces of everything ... .
no i 'm not talking to my stomach i 'm talking to my very talkative `` left wall section . ''
i think .
that 's probably a holiday that beats new year .
that kinda gave me the creeps .
*wump* sleeep ... ... ... ...
uhh ... .
everything was just fine.=p .
it 's not their fault that hitler told them to ...
-english was funny .
and sergei gonchar with the bruins ... ... .
8:50ish ?
ms. manson had to go to a track meet so she quickly assigned us to our groups for the final year end group project , and then left .
*both turn around* `` raaaaaaaaaave party !
not that i care since i have badminton anyways ... .
dunno why but i 've got hooked on that stuff lately .
i need to know more about it !
note taking like usual .
we did decent , though we could have done better i think .
she arrived about 10 minutes late .
when i was leavin for home i saw mike n ' dan , so we walked to the stop .
`` do n't bother me . ''
girl named cassandra stopped by .
i was gon na go study ... ..
i slept .
offense never beats defense =p , as i would show in game 1 as i absolutely killed jason .
for me ... .
and props god jesus and holy spirit for allowing dan to redirect me .
real deep stuff but really makes me think twice about why i 'm so priviledged to know christ .
ha .
not that great of a movie .
reminded me of a remembrance day assembly .
let us hide ! ''
home stretch ! ! ! ! ! !
work my ass off until june and then do my gr .
i did n't feel like crap ... ..
but john seems to have lots of nicknames varying from mophead to t-time lol .
then off i went back home ...
but when lucas went up to play their piece ... .
but yeah anyways after piano i got home ... .
and i 've been averaging only 6 hours of sleep a night .
played some songs ...
what is this disorder you ask ?
and then sat on msn for a bit , ate a lot .
his entry for sunday is really meaningful so i urge you people to go to it .
so studyin ' for that right now while typing up this entry , and doing various other things like msn , listenin ' to music , and sitting in front of this compy typing up this ... ..
my power in each hand is still pretty uneven .
me and hammond started talkin ' about the previous teachers that we have had since wharton is out again w/ a hernia , so yeah we 've once again got another sub .
today was also the 2nd monthly hype exec meeting .
played some technique , songs , and then ... ...
funny people lol .
wonder if it 's the same one that used to come to my theory class ?
wednesday day 2 's i spend over 2 hours straight in stupid music room ... ... ..
they were at the ucc .
turns out i 'm wrong .
yeah it 's taken calvin , gavin and `` vboi '' over an hour to pierce josh 's d. hmm ... ..
i 'd be screwed in singles .
oh yeah and up until now ... ... .
oh yeah that brings up the other reason why i am 100 % behind grace fm .
hilarious hahaha .
meeting .
he was makin ' ms. manson seem like a dictator haha .
and maybe hopefully see some more positive things .
apparently stacie orrico existed back then ...
yes only a week of waiting !
now i 'm doing blog , eating , and gon na soon start h/w .
amazed at how many people were there .
* shut up if it is n't .
i have no idea why , but today i 've been pretty dead tired , despite sleeping in and everything .
lots of jokes .
futonics .
it was black .
really mitch is smart just that he 's pretty stupid at times .
same old .
very amusing lol .
paul and adrian are right when they say it 's a fun game .
but anyways to my school day .
oh yeah today another new kid came to church to .
last year being when i was 14* and somehow they beat us out .
whoo hoo !
played some bible pictionary , and then after that the card game `` killer . ''
that 's all i really have to say for the night .
but yeah if i could make a difference , i would have .
the kid traded in like 50 games and he still had to pay money afterwards lol .
ugh .
nhl playoffs pretty intense this year* i woke up around 7:30 and started doing my morning routine .
lunch ... ..
try to get more than 6 hours .
saw meaghan struggling to find an entrance so we eventually found the front entrance .
lets see ... .
which really sucked and in 2nd game we just blew it and loste11-4 .
well anyways now time to go on with the rest of my day ...
sc then sleep !
shmuck !
amidst all this though..
i was planning to practice a bit before performance time came ...
wth ?
went to pick up lina for her first day at lcac *wonder if she liked it* and then off to pick up jason also .
but anyways after that we then went to church , where we listened to pastor daniel tjoe-long *spelling of last name ?
well guess what ... ... .
oregano , chives , and some other crap .
no wait ... .
living off carrots and tea ... ...
but that 's ok it 's only history .
interaction 3 ... ..
dreaded history .
which is a change from the usual diving for the bell .
hmm what else ... ... ...
the one that 's been back there for ... .
but basically the message today was how christ , who came to the earth to die for us , did what 10,000 animal sacrifices could never do ... ...
being split up and playing music .
but one part that really caught me off guard and actually made me just tense up ... ..
i finally get out , head downstairs , and you know the usual routine by now after 108 entries .
but i ca n't really describe it in a funny way .
i do n't complain about a restaurant that serves really good food .
oh well least i had my fun this march break .
well in the end the praise team had quick meeting about what we could do to improve for next time .
might go there more often now =p .
old ... .
lol first of all the chair tilting .
i would make one counting down to tc .
but now that i think about it ... .
i 've technically got 1 gold , 4 silvers , and 1 bronze .
sergei and lance put up a real good fight with a routine ... .
that cancels out all possible sadness =p .
fiddled around with guitar *i can successfully change from g , to c , to e-minor to a now !
lol great times today at lunch .
1990/2000 free circle lol , trying to work on air chair and millz , oh yeah and calvin can sorta do headspin now .
and also ... ... .
turns out jason said he wants to come to basement jam too .
it was pretty sickening too though .
i actually got to school relatively early today ... ..
then i go into a room and all of a sudden the room starts to be covered in blood and my reflection freezes and gets covered in blood .
which really is n't that grand and then headed home ... .
i came in last score wise but who cares =p .
yeah it 's unusual ... ..
me and korpela kinda had the weirdest idea *patent pending* that i wo n't say what it is or else well ... .
ate food ... ..
why ca n't we do algebra ?
and of course hype sleepover !
2/16/04 west beats east !
my brain still seems to think that sleep time is until 2pm ... ...
the hype counselors like usual arrived according to chinese time *around 15 minutes late* and ali could n't manage to find mykono 's until she called brian lol .
the button `` 3d sound '' makes the speakers louder that 's all .
boring .
when it 's hometime !
and we were all stumped lol .
we slaughtered general greene .
my monitor right now ... .
so got up ... ..
i 'll be crammin lots tomorrow .
got there pretty early today .
mmm ... .
but yeah we then watched a bit of slam dunk competition ... ...
but now that i 'm doing good in gr .
somethin to do .
we unpacked .
like usual i was loud ... ..
and then ate .
it 's summer !
got to like 45 .
lol on a passing play she would run it then pitch it 4 times before her player was downed lol .
i dunno when they did..
but then again it 's cool to see how much we 've all grown hehe .
well headed to school then ... .
i think half of our band is just flutes ...
we had team missionaries come in and speak to us .
what am i gon na be when i grow up ?
apparently i 'm now part of senior band for good , playing in intermediate band , and also stage band x .
she was still out on her lunch break .
so i ended up working out w/ hammond n mitch and them , and then after a bout a 1 and a half hour workout we watched the highlights of superbowl 37 and how the bucs got there and won .
learned about governments..
only 5 more months till i 'm that old .
meh .
yup ...
i actually think i sorta needed it ... ... .
least i can still sleep .
time for ... ... ... .
gloria can you add exponents ?
well basically @ lunch today i had to study for bio .
* but semi finals and finals were the huge highlights .
no more school for the next two days .
eventually we lost around 11-7 ... ..
a feeling that i had forgotten ever since 2:30 when i left school .
jason 's online friend sauron came along again too .
well i did n't care .
was n't too bad .
except afterwards while reading jason 's gmr magazine ... .
and my chest feels messed up still too from bench .
yeah we pretty much made a good looking game look its worst .
but we played this game where we had to identify ourselves from fgt ... .
judging this restaurant is like judging a book by its cover .
think i might join up .
what an idea !
got ta sleep though soon ...
gargh ... .
yeah i know no life but who cares lol i 'm dead tired today .
never fails to amuse me .
one big topic we talked about was the game where gimpy got tooled .
i started to breakdance a little bit again , and also i tried out some basketball .
i do n't really know what else to say today ... ..
eheheheheheh sorry 'bout that by the way wendy but yeah ... ... .
well we walked to dundas and richmond stop , where i took the cherryhill , then transferred onto whitehills .
* sounds more exciting than jean chretien or paul martin ... ...
the outside ... .
they already started so yeah we were late lol .
so after he said that , i just thought of all the sins that i kind of just quickly asked for forgiveness , then shoved it into the back of my mind .
by the time that was over ... ...
footlocker .
took cherryhill today instead of whitehills as i was too lazy to wait for whitehills .
squashed most of em ... .
had a pizza at jasper 's today that was really good and john apparently got addicted to chimichangas ...
ok so not annoying exactly but ... ..
found out jason bought nfl street ... ..
ate first of course ... .
thirst is everything .
flyers won tonight i think ... .
but now time for class =p .
10 mins away .
well actually his son scott did .
so after service , i went downstairs as usual .
wish them the best of luck on future edeauvours though hehe =p .
wow if this could ever get up and running again that would be so cool .
or world issues ?
period .
but i kinda forget em ehehehehhehee .
think i prayed at least 3 times throughout the exam lol .
best friends w/ arjun and christian ?
moron .
and it 's kinda funny .
i mean ... .
must ... .
but yeah ... .
anyways yeah i 'm out both ways so later .
supposed to meet dad @ alumni @ 9:15 for a ride so you can see i was already late .
robert 's teddy routine ... ...
he did n't do that bad of a job either .
with all the technical difficulties , and seem-to-be poor preperation , just the environment was n't too appealing .
yeah picked up senior band uniform and then stage band x practice .
took lina and jason home first , and then got home to see a whole lunch of take-out dim sum already out .
after service ... ..
what a smurf .
though i ahve a minivan now it still is n't comfy having 7 people in it .
hype has got ta be one of the best meetings ever ... .
so yeah ... ..
apparently t720 really does have crap receptio lol .
wow i was lucky i did n't buy silent hill 3 from zellers .
josh talked about his little talk w/ lily about religion .
too much to explain ... .
at other times it just hurts *ow .
stage band ... ...
afterwards we finished up our lesson on god 's presence with different names for him throughout the bible .
anyways it 's kinda like hearts ... ..
but yah so far is n't bad .
at school ... ...
* it 's a good reminder .
low radiation my ass .
then ride home ... .
it was cool though how ali picked a verse for each of us .
this was when my file would be lost ... .
but now yeah off to bible study time .
anyways after that i ate , finished some h/w , then played ddr .
i ate that ...
we got silver yesterday , and of course the senior jazz band whooped ass .
if i could post a pic up i would .
but when your teacher is blabbing about economics in history class ... ..
even i 'd be saying praise the lord for her to be staying here ... .
i lost all my pieces ... ...
and it came through in the end with a healthy 88 and second place plus a silver award that is shared evenly among all the stage band x members .
but anyways ... ... .
that 's one reason why i like badminton : such a lazy sport = ) .
played some piano ... ..
it was reallly nice .
by all means go for it .
5/6/04 tv : one inatimate object that i nearly forgot about =p tv .
programming .
go away now .
12 's are looking for scalpers for semi , since it 's their last year .
so we had announcements and went downstairs .
so falling into the temptation *oh no ... ..
so today was n't horrible ... .
and jason beat me to my own house .
grabbed jt , and then grace and then we were off to church .
really the other ones would just follow .
yup ... .
waaay more laid back and not as serious .
totally burned out finally !
would have more time to study .
we basically just chilled ... ..
for another day of high school .
prayed about so much ... ..
but i do n't think i did that bad .
we have to do some project about us being a political party .
so quickly ate that ... .
and today i realized that jason paid more than he did at basemant jam than he was supposed to .
really retarded song in my opinion ... .
it was pretty amusing though tonight , but i 'll fill you in on that later =p .
*post post ... .
i mean tc 2004 , the talk at fellowship , and the somewhat ongoing debate in my mind about d/l music .
self explanitory from the first paragraph i ended up going .
i think it went well .
so i started thinking about that during sermon for about 30 minutes .
hopefully i can maybe make a web layout sometime soon or sometin .
it was a scary thought ... ...
so out came the snowblower .
anyways i helped rebecca usher for a bit before we headed into the worship .
wow what a small world just thinkin ' about it now .
people were just looking at us as they passed by with the weirdest faces .
* for abortion though , i was whooping some ass =p .
so headed upstairs ... ...
ugh i was wrong .
and ... .
oh yeah neither in english .
blog !
then came announcements .
to go to the ddr competition ?
well that was until i left .
like me actually doing decent at kiwanis , and learning that reading can actually be amusing at times .
went on computers to do some research on our government .
i found my bag afterwards ^_^ .
actually i started this frenzy during august but i did n't know how to use the program .
prayer groups got together w/ gavin , jason , and lina .
and then me and thompson played some pool .
and headed to head 2 head ... ..
little girl : tommy , do you see the tree outside ?
like missing out half of english class ... ..
seriously does the ontario gov't really think we do n't know what rain is and how it forms ?
uhh ... ..
after music class ... ..
it 's really kinda cool actually how my week started ... .
hmm ... .
i 'm off now .
although it was that , i had to spend most of my afternoon at the optometrist ... ...
hmm ... ..
i thought piggy backing would be easy , so karen hopped on ... .
ok ... ..
our morning started off bad .
dun , dun ... .
i 'm happy ea finally learned that 1st person shooters and ps2 just do n't mix .
*cough ... ..
now i 'm back home .
so people for now i 'm out .
it started with a crappy 3-0 run by them ... .
we should n't really worry about that as worship is n't about the instrument , it 's about your heart .
you know gun barrel sighting him ...
props to all tcers ... .
oh yeah and i 've now set the bar of insect classification as this : `` anything below 5 feet is an insect ...
some thing i want to put in ... ...
i guess the world war ii and world war i obsessions that me pat paul and colin had from back in grade 7 and 8 really paid off .
5/11/04 another lazy day brain ...
hmm for once i actually had to use my locker for kiwanis stuff , badminton stuff , and a whole potpurri of other junk .
apparently there 's parabolas and circles in it .
was n't on msn or drums or anything ... .
well now i 'm home and am probably gon na go watch snl in a bit .
yeah it was pretty funny some of the stuff that happened .
hope that goes well i really need direction in life right now .
i 'll go drum around for a bit ... .
we lost 15-8 *crappage* lol .
they ai n't good enough for it .
who cares if it was $ 6.00 ? !
ate ... ..
pretty cool sight .
got to school around 8am today since patrick needed to grab sometin ' , and i needed to go talk to mrs. wharton anyways .
so i 'm not really panicking .
predestination ... ..
from yelling stupid stuff like `` get better cleats '' or `` you 're cut you stupid receiver , '' `` you ca n't hit like that , '' `` wth ! ? ? ! ? ! ?
and i forgot what the square root of one is .
music was first class of the day .
12 like i said ... .
basically to me the message told me basically about how god 's calling can really be emphasized towards you .
for example we figured to break the bubbles that we would for prayer groups split up the bubbles and get the people to be with different people ... .
but thawed out overtime .
11 and 12 social science courses , since history was one .
i really wish i lived in toronto .
well yeah i was watching that commercial yesterday ... .
waking up 30 minutes before my exam though , yes things like that can happen .
then after picking up carmen ... ...
first off ... .
a sunday full of work ugh ... .
and i guess i 'll be attempting graffiti again w/ adobe photoshop .
well today actually was an ok day ... ..
and slowly winding down to the end ...
today 's meeting also marks how close we are to summer holidays ( for uwo students ) and how some of them are leaving = ( .
so basically well i basically just download the music for appreciation .
boooooring .
yeah this week 's total practice time : 140 minutes lol .
the 1st vs. 2nd place battle was between the two albino crews , with lots of popping and toprock .
well simply because i barely went to school today lol .
i notice im whizzing by my school day cuz today was damn boring .
very flawwed out .
i used the term `` hat-trick '' as first i 'm a hockey fan and i felt god has majorly showed me three amazing things this last week .
gavin totally failed with the hair gel so her hair looked pretty much the same lol .
well , spiritually , tc really did boost up my christian walk .
he set it back another hour .
we did wait for hermann but he never came so we left .
well patrick came over for a lift around 7:50 ...
chris left a bit early for some reason ... ...
yeah so we ate , chatted , hung around ... ...
there 's much brighter things to think about in our lives .
i make sense huh =p .
for example ...
but kinda peeved that nashville 's out .
oh yeah but jason came out for lunch today also .
though there were some rushing issues with trumpets .
what 's so great about leap year anyways ?
well when i got home ... .
lots of snow ... ...
but that 's already almost catching up to many asian avenue people .
fob/matrix/mr .
it was pretty cool though ... .
seriously the gov't should maybe spend this $ $ $ on the army instead of us .
whipping with sticks , and then the flog .
the movie though i really recommend .
arve was pmsing afterwards lol .
anne 's imitation crying lol wow it was funny .
so yeah that 's basically my day up until 5pm .
yeah also asked if i could play keys next year for jazz band ... .
i was going to wake up at 9 and practice piano for 2 hours to cram in some time so my teacher would n't kill me , but i decided to hit the snooze button and wake up at 10 .
they 're as cuddly and lovable as ... ..
yeah showed some tc vids ... ..
and blasted daylight savings time ... .
lates=p .
urllink what about you ?
we took one hour to rehearse the one and only song we are performing and we still sounded like crap .
but yeah some of the other room combos are pretty funny .
holy crap i totally forgot !
aww crap forgot the word for greek coffee w/out sugar now .
i 'm surprised we even got seeded lol ... ..
so i 'll just summarize my totally bummed out day ...
ugh now i have to quiet down my hopping .
i do n't know what he coulda done from air chair .
too tired to pay attention .
then headed for lunch .
it was overall a good week .
good series .
anyways i did make it for prayer still , where i was grouped with josh and wendy , and also for gorgon !
today i 'm just gon na relax , and wait for the mosh of people coming over for dinner lol .
yes preparing for my 3 hour car ride out to toronto in a really big blizzard .
which is almost perfect timing to be surfing blogs .
yeah that was part two of distinguishing the saying about faces on grills .
lunch went to jasper 's again today ... .
anywho dad came , picked up me jason and lina and headed home ... .
* so managed to talk with jaclyn and lindsay while there lol .
mostly consisted of playing piano , trombone , and then going home for naps = ) .
now back to the talent show ... ...
i mean the start to a new badminton season ... ..
actually i just need a new board period .
or sleep .
put me into some new thoughts in life hmm ... ... .
it can be your worst enemy .
then ... ... .
i decided to dribble around a basketball and sit on the comp @ church for a bit surfing da net while waiting for josh to come .
i am a gentile .
ali first asked us ... .
jasper 's ...
i was actually pretty happy w/ my round though .
yeah we lost pretty bad ... .
us brass people just sat around twidling our thumbs ...
so in the end we got some family plan , and activated my motorola c370 or sometin like that and mom 's lg *eew i hate lg phones .
ugh ms. wiener ca n't figure out how long it takes an average grade 10 to do an in class lab .
well me nate n ' thompson went out for subs originally .
oh yeah ... .
got a drive from dave 's parents to the subway stop ... ..
wow reflecting on your week until 3am is n't exactly most intelligent thing to do the night before church ... .
and then home .
lunchtime : went to go try on band uniform then head out for lunch ... ..
i mean it was n't that bad at first , but when one lash actually was latched in his skin and the roman just rips it out ...
that it does n't matter what you 're church looks like *my church is kinda small* but it matters on the state of the people .
and like usual the other 3 did lots of fancy stuff .
one was stalked over msn ( matt ) and the other has slipped playing bowling ( ada ) .
oh well ... ..
for me saturday !
wow ... ..
wow ... ...
grrr ' ugh ... ...
i actually didnd't fall asleep in bio for once ! !
`` give me oil in my lamp '' is the title , and basically the workshop was to help us put our christian lives back on track , which i really needed .
me and mitch well kinda broke one of the rows of seats in the bus lol .
well least i know more people in this class .
* so we took a case and started making two cups , when then the whole hype group plus jt , and kendrick and the people that were with kendrick wanted one too .
so i avoided one thing lol ...
and the movies almost 3 hours .
and connor and arjun entered at the wrong bar ... ...
prepare to write exam on thursday .
*shrug* after school ... ...
right now ... ..
but can be used for other events as well ...
actually it was n't as i 'll explain later ... .
speaking of skills/talents it was kinda interesting how my fellowship will tie into this .
nothing can defeat the word of prayer in my mind .
well mom was n't home , so i had to get the key 's from my grandma *she lives across the street .
seriously what the heck kinda record setting is that ?
played some nfsu ... ... ..
many congrats steph =p .
with some moustached dude lol .
`` ok n/m lol .
anywho ... ..
oh yes right that =p hehe almost forgot about that government facility that over 5000 kids in london go to 5/7 days of the week .
though i was a bit late , we still got a few things done .
anyways i 'm out .
now to my day .
apparently he has a different one though , which is kinda weird .
plus a trophy !
but of course after 5 years he seems to be enjoying the environment .
lunchtime !
but for now ... ..
but she had to walk to a bus stop ... .
yay !
represent lcac lol ) .
good workout though .
noooooooooooo !
after school instead of goin ' to jason 's to look at his mutated ant i went home instead hoping for a nap .
and then jason played wendy ... .
quake iii is so funny and stupid ...
me and gavin ... .
and i still ca n't settle back into my schedule before march break .
but yeah apparently her church watched the clips from the night *a lot of people recorded* and it was phenomenal .
i should have done more devos ... .
really felt good emptying all those canned in emotions .
then we got home .
best imitation i can make is the cheap laugh mike has at times haha .
mmmmm perogies and quesadillas ... .
onto careers ... ..
though it 's dead .
well i 'm gon na head to sleep soon ... .
but reason two was just because we sucked .
some interesting stuff happened .
and asked job why he was blaming god for everything .
that 's the only problem i find with doing worship for service ... ..
rhoden abused this priviledge by chatting to almost every kid on the left side of the classroom , and by the time mr. curphey could hobble over there , justin would mockingly pretend to hobble away .
me and dave were still pondering on where the shortcut was ... ..
history was same old ... .
and i 'm off ... .
see this is how i fell asleep ... ...
*1 hour later* ok now it 's actually 830 *unlike that stupid fake 830 an hour ago* and now i 'm alive and about .
like photocopy budget ?
and actually viciously attacked pokan lmao .
he happened to find a big indent to hide behind for cover , and he said that as he was sitting there with all the stuff flying by he felt and pictured god `` holding him by the neck with a dagger in other hand . ''
so far in the book ... ..
it all seemed like the usual picturing ... .
in time it may come out though but right at the moment i think i need more reflection about it than speaking out .
amazingly though ... .
so you new ?
usually i toprock for 10 secs than go into 6-step lol .
but yeah this year 's tc interaction bible study was great .
and we had to tape the sheets we had the other day about someone from fgt into a big tapestry ...
when she called him joe by accident his reply : `` how dare you insult me like that . ''
now ... ..
then went out for lunch .
oh yeah and on a side note ...
wow that was a close one .
* highlights of battle ?
does that count as a car ?
oh yeah i did have band today .
`` releasing his tiger '' according to mr. mccumber .
our band was able to basically play out a whole song in 15 minutes .
joe has entered the court !
today i actually woke up before 12pm .
setting your clock backwards more than it already is ?
the area had a shortage of water , and we had to come up with a solution .
pretty exciting compared to sitting in a mazda mpv for most of my drives around town .
do n't have ? !
then some chatting ... .
good call =p .
made a few maaaaad diving shots ...
lunchtime !
morning went by pretty quickly ... ...
so yeah when his `` replacement '' came booooooo !
i 'll have more on half blindness later =p .
i 've started to like public speaking ^_^ .
fastest civics class ever i think happened today =p .
now though ... ... .
no winners .
i wo n't mention one of them as it was a pretty embarassing counsellor moment but here 's the one i will mention : ken : what 'd you think of steven carrying the cross with christ ?
i 've survived 7 months of this crap already ... .
yup ... .
plan 7 days ahead !
we did n't bring our a game for sure ... .
and got to school .
nfl street and studying actually paid off at jason 's .
which sounds really retarted .
ms. manson : alright class today we begin to look at what else was happening around the world in world war ii .
and then left .
oh yah ... ...
2/11/04 short day ... ..
great ending to a good talent show .
so yeah i had a bit of a bad hairday today .
boo .
as half of it was cut short from sleep and kiwanis .
though in the end he believed it was worth it ... ..
at first only me and josh were the only kids from hype but gavin and jason pulled through and got there halfway through .
it was a funny class though ... ...
something like that anyways .
wish i coulda gone to the chrome tonight for the bboy event ... .
well their slices are pretty good anyways , and we also bought a medium pizza and split it lol .
something we needed though since we had to haul in a thing or two into the church ...
so do n't know what they did lol .
nothing exciting .
then bused home ... ... ...
gr .
yeah we go pretty insane after a while .
so i do n't start to do stupid things at home ... .
so i decided to pretend to look like i was doing something class related ... .
so yeah just wait till the summer boys n ' girls ... ..
two thousand freaking four and i 'm still stuck here with a quarter and calling card .
oh yeah and me , gavin josh and calvin ... .
6 db 's should do it lol .
yeah i 'm kinda not regretting going to north park lol .
also our dollar has sucked over the last 10 years .
that 's real original is n't it .
right ?
and gavin came over for a bit of jamming w/ drums and geektar .
and what they agreed and disagreed with .
finally we head to church = ) .
math test : was easier than i thought .
but when the teacher gives u a review sheet with 21 questions ... .
eaton centre is actually such a crazy mall .
yeah she still did n't really get how it 's wrong to clog two lanes to fill up one car at a gas station .
and also the last day of me spending time in t-dot .
he 's always there .
wow .
we ate ... .
when you 're half sick writing a test ... ... .
or maybe 4 .
but yeah basically that was the highlight of the night .
rhythmic dictation course ?
so cool .
but tonight i 'm doing my praise night compy presentation for tomorrow ... ..
though i wasted one hour doing something i did n't have to do ... ... .
foooood .
but lost .
i woke up at 12 ( wow i have n't done that in a week ) and then headed out for piano @ 1230 .
you know ... .
it was great and all ... .
junior one really seems watered down from the previous ones .
but anyways yeah we `` programmed '' all class .
and that basically describes it .
then again it can be good .
so i think that i 'll summarize my school day : -woke up -music was boring -science we had a sub ... .
finlan 's trombone skillz would actually look mediocre for once if he played today ... ... .
maybe homework ?
my coffee did n't affect me that bad ... ... .
i mean job was tested , and he was rewarded .
as i actually never knew she was the only uwo student at lcac at one point .
we 've been gettin ' less voters as years have gone by .
i mean ... ..
well compared to saunders .
hehe yay ! ^_^ .
but yeah after a song of response and offering *gloria almost forgot she was ushering* and then we all headed downstairs like usual for chatting .
you watch some a. d. d. retard for almost 40 minutes talking about clouds ... ..
if i do n't answer it the first time ... .
she 's short ...
even we think we sounded bad but meh , if he says it 's good ... ...
what would happen if harlem or compton had an olympics ?
though we suffered waiting in the stupid bus for an hour for the teacher to get keys , *it seemed like an hour , more like 30 minutes i guess* and then ... .
so yeah he was playin comp , and i decided i 'd nap .
mrs. gayed could n't hold in her laughs either ... ... .
well got home , and calvin called *whew .
heh these few months have shown me so many people that sacrifice so much to get to know god .
so me and him started one of the biggest cannon building projects ever lol .
freetime was awesome lol .
hmm since one of my toms is broken decided to do a new drum layout .
we start off in like a sappy remix of `` heart of worship '' and then all of a sudden after a 1 second pause we go straight into evanescence 's song that has that loud yelling dude and the lyrics go sometin like `` wake me up wake me up inside ca n't wake up something something something '' and you get the point evanescence sucks =p .
yeah confirmed with jason we chillin ' tomorrow @ eaton center , and also just last minute contacts/chats with martha dudes/dudettes and of course people from other groups like usual =p .
well now i 'm gon na quickly refresh my mind on grade 2 theory for a test tomorrow then sleep .
oh yeah turns out icy really does have braces .
i ca n't fail history ... .
but decided that since i have time might as well do it the usual way ... .
wow my shoe was actually getting stuck in the mud ... ..
and started chucking the ball from half court .
i do n't know why but it seems that this dream really does mean something .
practiced manual shifting again w/ a waterbottle *i was terribly bored* and then we went home .
usually my mark estimates are decent .
put it this way forget the hat-trick thing .
liam said he went to the place a few times ... .
praise for sunday ... .
30 minutes ?
we sat around shoving food in our faces for a good 2 hours .
sucker .
takes so much stinkin ' time to complete and money ... .
-got home ( its about 4:00 by now ) -went on comp for a bit -slept -woke up @ 9 -did some homework -chatted for a bit on msn -typed up emailed prayer requests .
i hate technique .
like this one where i said he probably thought march break was in january and jason said let 's test that theory out *pretends to call him .
watch it at www .
wow ... .
for our `` talent '' at our other performances .
but what about the sink ? =p .
and another teacher came in *mr .
oh yeah jacky and carmen also came today *the leungs* so we had some more people to chill with =p .
sermon today was about the gospel of john .
afterwards calvin ate it lol and we replaced it with the remains of the chocolate ...
er chair for music class ... ... ..
do n't know what i 'd do w/out backup haha .
* grrr ...
it also made me think of the book left behind .
yay !
and i ca n't think of much else to say about my day .
first game 11-2 ... ..
at first i thought of atlantis ... .
well as a joke cuz seriously who da hell would play ps2 w/ a cross , clove of garlic and shotgun beside em ?
wee .
wrote theory exam application form .
that 's how long hype 's been around for .
then after that i decided to listen to more music , in hopes of ignoring them lol .
but why not go to ucc and watch people breakdance there ?
that candle flame has just burned out .
stupid broken english false advertising ... .
yes sleeping in till 830 *shweet .
now i got ta find some music to go with this theme ... ..
day 1 's are so boring .
somethin i shoulda d one 2 weeks ago .
mmmmmmmmmmm ... ... ...
today i got ta have a cheesy summary style blog .
talked about leaders and organizations that have affected the world .
they ate dinner here and stuff then left .
and also head quarters ... .
but i like his style too though .
* oh yes and of course ...
was ... ..
well `` yelling . ''
but when we saw the twisted metal of two tractor trailers , mangled in a ditch , we were all horrified .
anyways i 'm out for the night .
yeah some funny moments there .
who has happily volunteered to aid in helping hype for the summer ... .
band was just a run through of all the songs through the year .
i remember why i do n't play singles .
first nap in car *zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz* and then got home .
apparently he was raised in a pretty crummy area , his parents divorced , and he just never had a decent childhood .
for the 4th night in a row ! ! !
we got to have a quick run through of piece being up there .
took the bus w/ ryan and we decided to meet up at the park to play some ball after school .
me and jason are planning to study at the library tomorrow morning .
also like any other morning , i did my morning routine , got packed up and headed out the door , eyes still drooping and everything still seeming like a blur to me at 645am .
ok real reason : calvin checked me into a wall ...
nice ending to a great trip .
the rest was fun =p .
i doubt it though ...
so when worship started ...
was n't that bad .
oh yeah and on a side note , for me preparing a prayer during song of respone for offering did n't work lol .
yeah after school life consisted of tv , sc , piano practice , and some homework .
it was lunch .
they are friends but seem so hostile to one another .
over and over again lol .
anyways ... ...
wow a 75 minute full test .
it 's not bad .
over i never thought i 'd fall to such a level of laziness ... ..
when finlan takes a shot and mr. douglas decides to stand 7 feet from him .
lol .
anyways ... .
and then we left for school .
food is good .
i was surprised to see how many people i knew were there .
that pretty much sums up my 7/10 day .
k ... .
smurf mostly would be the ultimate universal word lol .
sleep , piano , sc , then hype .
even tommy remembers it hehe .
etc ... ..
sorta .
wow my comp truly define the term `` scrap metal . ''
*shrug* i still have an 83 in math ... ..
yay !
but that 's ok. point is it 's good .
lol but nothing was as bad as quinn ... .
for some reason all these kids seem to have add .
we had everything though , the gym , lounge etc .
and i was just almost in tears in seeing so many people either re-dedicating or dedicating for the first time .
boring and useless =p .
there 's a story written on the bottom of the shoes .
wo n't have to go through all the annoying crap @ 30 when you 're only 15 , 16 , etc .
then dan sat on msn for a bit and i played underground .
but after this hectic week ... .
fred for some reason got to school in a checker , which kinda surprised me .
perfect timing .
here 's the result : an aerial view of `` g. i .
bass+piano is n't that bad of a combo at all .
mmmm ... .
probably failed midterms .
grace fm ... .
later everyone .
very .
spent time in library lookin ' over script w/ group .
with the senior band *the one i 'm in* ending off the night with `` do not go gentle into that good night , '' `` godzilla attacks las vegas , '' and `` vesuvius . ''
ugh so much work ...
so when i got to his place to pick him up ...
let the games begin .
bah .
yeah arve and his friend got really pissed off .
so they improvised with a long video , and one of the members of the group lecturing about the lymphatic system .
which is apparently a crapload .
yeah i think it was .
oh yeah and the song son of a gambolier ... ... .
even though 15 flutes were missing today ... .
hope it 's easy .
i do n't have my contacts yet anyways ... .
and me and jason made plans to play ball after church @ ucc .
it was usual .
get stuffed almost everytime i go for layup ... .
this was about the first time *wait maybe 2nd , the time i refunded ps2 i had lots of 20's* my wallet could n't close properly .
once i got home ... .
i am still awesome !
oh yeah also tomorrow mrs. wharton 's back to teach us !
was n't too bad though ... .
well had a chicken quesadilla today from that place ... ...
*gets impaled by one and dies .
`` i learn my english from star wars yoda . ''
*picks out paper* joe and calvin vs ... ..
yeah life would be pretty drab without calvin coming up with another intelligent `` talent . ''
robert 's alright ever since i got to know him better from working on bio presentation together ... ..
they managed to sing it for an hour , i know this as they started singing on the outskirts of toronto and reached -2 bottles of beer on the wall ( accompianment by me and josh ) by the time we reached markham , where i 'm staying .
see ... ..
that 's what sportscentre is for lol =p .
from me ! ?
ca n't even feel triceps .
very fun day .
try not to pirate it it 's really worth seeing .
banting did decent , but like i mentioned before played a song central 9ers learn , and still manage a gold .
the only reason right now why some of the music seems so hard is because i seem to have difficulty counting 9/8 and 8/8 time lol .
and boom .
least i 'm sessioning = ) .
and do/think about things positive if you want the heavenly father to be with you .
badminton was actually pretty fun today .
this one has to be worth it .
reunion in summer k = ) .
threatened to cut off his leg and hit us with it .
oh yeah , and also talking on msn i told marcello i mite buy silent hill 3 , and he sorta said was kinda pointless since the game is kinda `` scary '' i would play it alone and i should just rent it ... ..
all thanks to contac-c lol .
why not learn something productive ! ?
i 'd be dead tired by the time performance came .
anyways i 'm out though for good now ... ..
will it happen ?
perogies ^_^ .
yay ... .
missionaries can be very devoted .
mmmmmm .
or w/e msg stands for ...
but we did have some visitors to do worship .
why must rain come now ? !
all things are happy now ! ''
got ta make it good so they do n't kill me if i suck lol .
it 's good !
not bad considering i 'm barely getting some of the things .
went onto urbandictionary .
i can see why he was nicknamed `` bones . ''
event b : played ball w/ patrick for a bit ... .
wow did i suck at playing .
yup ... ..
nooooooooo !
i am reallly thankful for making it to day 2 this year ... ..
and of course most of us know what happened in wwii .
then for some reason he starts to play patrick finlan in a game of ball .
and oh yeah one horrid sounding oboe *they sound worse than clarinets ugh .
do n't know why ... ...
everyone 's lazy =p .
no friendly battles or anything today .
like how so much in society is poison ( his song `` poison '' ) .
it was four ... .
about how the offence has to press onward towards the endzone to achieve their goal , and also how they can start from anywhere , but their goal is still the same .
bland i guess .
why ca n't our church have dsl internet ? !
i guess reading is n't that bad after all .
but i still do n't get why some people sometimes despise valentine 's day .
crap !
i studied a bit more and then renewed my book .
well ... ..
i do n't blame em though ... .
gay !
our group really has to start working on ours .
math class actually was pretty funny today though .
watch out jack white we gaining real fas *not .
patient , perfectionist , lots of people are music freaks *including me ... ..
so i 'm off !
said our heys then kinda left , since i think he was catching a train and i was trying to run back to gavin josh and dave .
need to figure out basically my life by next friday *eep .
cya =p .
anyways ... .
wee !
trombones like usual sound good ... ...
bah !
boy was i wrong .
i just hope it has the same effect on them as it did on the people that went last year .
finally ... ...
gt 4 graphics are amazing i also found out today and starcraft ghost ... .
jason seemed pretty cheery for having to wake up at 7am this morning since i had to pick him up early .
i made it to day 2 !
* so this year i 'm pretty happy with my results , seeing that i barely practiced 30 minutes a day ... .
and then announcements came on .
and i thought the music was a little bit difficult ... ..
i 'm out for the night .
got ta do that too .
yah i know ... .
yes !
however , canada also does become imperialist sometimes , with capitalizing other countries with our banks , and also only helping those countries that may benefit our nation in return .
also we got a tea dispenser now at my house ^_^ .
but got ta try that next time .
come on avs !
while doing this process ...
but yeah had some of that w/ some beef ... ...
* bio class was pretty short , and robert read over some of my notes as he did n't make any .
11ish ?
for some reason brian wong tried skin moisturizer *wth is wrong with this world now ? !
my smash receiving is pretty much the best @ church at the moment , plus out of the people i know .
hmm ... ...
chatted w/ maggie and jess whittaker for a bit , and chris near the end .
and she wants me to call her then ... ..
well as long as i 've been around hehe .
well i walked in actually before and saw mitch w/ the knife ... ...
ow .
today was communion to though ... ..
that 's one reason why i like hype , it gets me out of the house for sure each saturday lol , and also i 'm happy i live by masonville and uwo .
here 's your daily cup o ' joe ... .
ha he 's lame and that 's lame ... ...
booooo !
talked to them for a bit .
not .
and some other person would have had the priviledge of getting 3rd ! ...
shweet .
exams are a breeze anyways .
oooh look at me i know how the canadian government works !
pretty tired ...
it 's the worst .
well then yeah i played a few games of sc , was n't too bad had a few fun ones .
well almost ... .
bootlegging .
wow what a strategy there ... .
and gavin ... ... ... ...
i guess i 'm kinda going off track with my devos ... ..
so after that talk , we ended in a word of prayer , and josh had to go back to his room to sleep and me and gavin just chatted for a bit and then also headed for some shut eye .
so i kinda accidentally skipped a whole page of music in godzilla eats las vegas .
oh yeah and jason found his 3cm cockroach/ant ... .
then me and nick started talking about ... ..
but then when i looked at the clock ... .
whoo .
he as saying how one time this one salesman came and showed him this powerful cleaner and then the reverend 's own .
maybe one because many are fairly old ... ..
think brian wong 's with arjun and some other people .
the event thinking was probably the most challenging ... ..
me mike n ' dan studied from 3-6 @ library .
and we see hermann .
net ) but i think icy kinda wronged them with their saying that in real life not everyone carries around a melee weapon .
math class ... ... ..
still disturbing lol .
history is n't exactly important .
yeah i know this blog kinda sucks , but i really do n't have a thinking mind right now , nor was my day extremely exciting .
especially also since 60 % of central students are in the music program .
when i think about all the racial issues back in wwii , i sometimes wonder if hitler would have won or not if those 6,000,000 people he killed fought for nazi germany instead .
yeah ... ... ..
something i 've never done !
so this morning was a bit welcoming i guess ... .
they were pretty smooth i was surprised .
english class ... ..
then i had to stay back because i left `` early . ''
since he brought his guitar , we thought we 'd `` jam '' for a bit downstairs w/ drums and guitar combo ... ... ... ... ... .
so yeah kiwanis is n't over this year until near the very end for me .
com says its a `` boston shooting jersey . ''
and now to english .
the message today was very hard-hitting in me .
then after that we decided to make more ... ... .
cya !
it was band today ... ..
but she would rather have me on trombone .
* jt also came by and said hi , but yeah lots of people were there .
oh yeah was my first time co-leading a bible study !
dun !
me ... .
do n't leave it for final days of month *oops .
and holy crap i 'm lucky that that i posted as i just closed my window lol .
lol sewage gas exploding who woulda thought .
4 slices of pizza =p .
showed up late both times .
grandma and uncle john came over .
mr. dayus is gon na probably kill us one of these days , and it was boring like usual .
so ... ... .
another thing is we brought up issues and tried thinking of ways to resolve it .
5/25/04 my day once again ruined by english ...
we are still doing pyshics in class ... ..
8 piano =p .
well off to science .
never really thought of it as a prayer request sorta thing ... .
why do n't they just teach key signature ... ..
i mean though josh ca n't make it to the planning tomorrow nor rebecca , me gavin and maybe carmen will still push ahead and try to come up with as much as we can .
lol so got to church on time still ... ... .
hype meeting of course also had teaching ... ..
so yeah basically adam did the powerpoint , i did the talkin for the intro and some other add-ins , and okanski and robert split up vitamins and minerals .
i got there think 5 minutes late .
and all of em were in gr 10 .
sometimes .
so i went to pick up gloria , and then headed to church .
so yes maybe we have a team already mauhahahahahahahahahaha .
then shovel the damn driveway again ... ..
nothing out of the ordinary .
and my civics class is so crappy ... ...
boy do i need a drum teacher ... ..
so really i think what gavin said makes a lot of sense ... ...
in the end ali wrote em all down ...
sc was amusing ...
i still find the attempt to teach teefy and whitney cantonese was hilariious w/ the `` deem ah whitney ! ''
yeah so that was basically the whole guidance appointment ... ...
wow what a long day today .
so the scapegoat of making fun of someone was ... ... ..
i 'm off to eat now .
and loud lol .
pray for me to finish 'em by may 5th lol .
i mean yeah they 're good but fighting over them ?
go avs !
but yeah truly unforgettable moment .
we then talked about the film ...
so got out of the car , and helped unload the stuff that my dad brought up in the van plus my luggage also .
did stuff w/ politics .
so after the service came home ... ...
yeah i guess i am kinda over optimistic .
in the end only the girls went .
well after waking up on a monday morning @ 6:30 for band , i got ready fairly quickly and darted out the door .
hahahahahaha and to think all i have to do is press 3 buttons now =p .
but yeah went to piano lessons , then right after that i headed off to church ...
oh well we still got to school on time at least .
least may camp will clear my mind out for a day or two =p .
katherine : do you know what i 'm saying ?
so after that ... .
kinda interesting today .
that works hehe .
lol or maybe it was just the cracker at the top acting as a plug .
today headed out to galleria .
and actually enjoyed today 's sermon = ) .
well after that steve pulled two flares ... .
jt and others : is n't his name simon ?
really long and ... ...
drummed mostly lol .
quiet lives now .
just rarely seem em lol .
yup ... ... .
that was basically it .
but yeah no breakin ' tonite ... ..
hmm ... ... ..
oh well , least he was n't having his daily mood swings today , or `` releasing his volcano . ''
i feel like the red wings right now back in 2003 when the ducks killed them in a 4-0 series .
then when we were eating thompson somehow brought up the idea of why asians are considered yellow when we really do n't even have any yellow ?
so i decided to pick up a form for london public library .
5 min bell just rang .
but the place was closed today .
whooooo !
yet we somehow seemed to mentally communicate .
and there 's not really anything that can change history now .
i do n't know , but i 'm sure as hell gon na be going to upper room or creation soon to grab more = ) .
really good seminar @ church though not much to say today .
i just felt the holy spirit just take over me and seem to say `` welcome back joe into god 's arms . ''
*wump* *four hours later* and now i 'm awake yet again ... .
1st set me and john got shut out for the first time in our lives .
food was horrible .
or the year after that .
so we kinda had to get josh 's stuff somehow .
i mean every day two really sucks , it was ended off with a really good ending .
the oasis pattern ! ''
15,000:500 minerals : gas ratio lol .
and we shoved everything in the fridge , hooked up ps2 ... .
but other than that ... .
it was really filling .
also not every building in africa makes nuclear weaponry ... ...
went snowboarding for most of it .
and now i say `` au revoir . ''
after a gruesome 30 minutes ... ..
but heck no .
oh yeah , josh was eating out of his bag of cancer while we were doing this ( mcd 's ... ..
shining with our many instruments ( over 40 flutes , something like 40 clarinets , heckload of brass and some saxophones , plus the percussio n ' stuff ) so we merged the two music homeroom classes together and had a full run-through rehearsal .
also talked about the purpose of easter holiday too hehe .
why the heck does canadian gov't make us do this ?
anyways yeah but all in all , amazing day , and look forward to my thursday and friday blogs .
also this : hammond : mitch , give me back my football .
well there 's also a u in suck *strange laugh like science geek from the simpsons* yeah the main focus was probably fred 's line ... ..
my brother 's been a bit mean to me lately .
pretty nice looking day today ... .
the music seemed to hit a whole new level .
wow ... ...
but then ... ... ...
lots of pictures !
yeah so so far basically the teams i rootin ' for *vancouver and colorado ... ..
except today went to ucc for badminton .
fun .
first christians are soldiers in the battle of heaven and hell .
new .
gagh .
and finally we arrive at gavin 's 30 minutes later .
i basically have this 104 key piece of crap memorized .
i mean hype already accounts for approx .
3/2/04 and still counting down to tc yeah you 're gon na have to live with my crummy titles for the next ... .
bell rings !
well i kinda got the hang of c from practicing it for 3 months , but yeah now i can almost play a whole song lol .
bribery .
4/3/04 why does it seem like the world is shrinking ? !
was pretty cool =p .
12 's not having tickets , huge lineups , and the trouble the school 's going through just to fit as many gr .
* then after getting everything set , we go and give mom her mother 's day gift ...
well my camera at least .
yeah my balance is very poor at 7am .
apparently she was gon na buy a fender amp *used* for 250 bucks with a cable , but josh talked her out of it saying it 's a ripoff .
jason went home .
that 's about the right ratio =p .
uh oh ... .
that was fairly interesting ... ...
took springbank up to josh 's .
anyways after that mitch 's hand was like dark purple .
but i 'm a fan of veggies .
really stupid .
so quickly studied for bio while munching on my quesadilla and also had my daily cup of java ... ..
and i 'll start with my day in 3 ...
as said ... .
first time working out in ... ... ... .
and some others it 's their final band of their lives ...
volleyball !
and gavin was sorta feelin ' sick he said .
and for the whole morning kendrick was looking for someone with nice writing to write sorta like a `` to : dan from : hype counselors '' sorta thing .
well im out .
almost a year ?
looked over notes one more time in the car listening to old skool music .
but is probably the best class to talk to people ^_^ .
i mean school i 'm trying to gun my average up , and theory ... ... .
last day for some uwo students .
the march class .
i dunno who he found in the end but he found someone lol .
and then civics class .
like the lord said : `` do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against one of your people , but love your neighbor as yourself .
i 've been there , done that , so i 'm not complaining *last year i got first on sometin .
-checked him into snowbank for vengeance ^_^ -bio class had a sub teacher and took down notes *lindsay did 2nd half of my sheet for me ...
so did that for two hours , then headed home .
so talked to him for a bit , then calvin , pokan ... ..
all i had to really do is get the slide show in order ...
rite now i think i 'm sitting at a healthy 85 % .
and only 10 gr.10 's .
and it 's true .
so i 'll see tcers on the 17th , and lates to all .
a 6th year student also thought that i was undergrad ... .
well ... .
physics is pretty boring like usual .
we finally got on the road after chinese service was over ... ..
we played basketball .
oh boy lol ... ..
finally getting to school around 810 or so , i quickly tread to music class since the bell was going to ring in 5 .
you know the part that 's coloured ?
taking ... ..
correction that this week has just been ... ..
might go do something w/ paul and colin later , or just mope around here ... .
sounds so bad and makes you look bad ... .
then my base was the center of fighting .
beat thompson 11-8=p .
least it 's only ddr ...
by the way that 's verse 8 .
apparently tomorrow we have a hype meeting .
anywho i 'm gon na go do something more productive than bloggin ... .
everyone is really excited .
`` no macking '' lol .
some of them do make things we use like aspirin .
in fact i tried it out today ... ..
i mean u ca n't exactly play a trombone w/ a desk in front of you .
so yeah there is definitely a reason why josh ca n't make it tomorrow ... ..
quick lunch ... ..
then lunch .
kills boler ... ..
i hit his car and i felt sorry for the guy ... ..
ate , morning routine , and then headed out the door for another day of ... .
bummer hehe .
so here it goes : -biology bellringer : smelly and i think i did ok. -english : bombed essay ...
gr .
whitney and mike i remember went up ...
and rhoden almost got kicked out of the classroom .
but yeah we boarded around until 10 .
a average badminton player who 's playing doubles this year ... .
it is possible to sleep more than 5 hours .
it was really interesting though how this dream even came about .
well anyways today i still have crappy millz , lost most of my power moves , but i still have handstand hops ^_^ .
* but the wall colliding ... .
mike became the class tool when he photocopied answer sheet for everyone .
well after stage band instead of going home ... ... .
what a chick flick but it was pretty funny at times lol .
plus no school tomorrow *badminton conference *and early dismissal wednesday .
waaah .
thompson and i were yelling across the classroom as usual , and as usual i got kicked out of the percussion section .
which was pretty bad .
well i think it is at least .
i surfed the net for a while .
was n't really that populated .
wow never knew they existed but yes they do .
winning against the senators ... .
that was basically it .
it was like 20 slaps to 15 .
never really stopping for a break or anything ... .
he seems to make everything right always ... .
wee !
pastor bartha was just an amazin ' speaker @ tc ( like the story of how someone was almost 'bout to kill him but backed off when bartha said if he died , then his word would spread even faster from the fact someone would kill him for that ) , sumair for his amazin ' story about how he came to christ , and today mr. len nation for basically giving us his testimony .
waaaaah ... ... ...
first thing i do ... ..
i was amazed to see that even with disabilities ... .
then got a ride to school .
so yeah we ended up kinda just milling around random places ...
did i let him borrow it ?
and angrily got out of bed ... .
thing is though i actually enjoyed the last episode , whichw as surprising since i never really even regarded it as a `` show ... .
yes i know it seems weird ... ... ...
just went home .
we worked and talked , and ate , and stuff for almost 3 hours .
*shrug* i think that i think just a wee bit too much on that subject .
but really cleared my mind .
test !
it 's the average , usual , central day ... .
since my drumhead broke ... .
my day started at around 10 or so ... .
yeah toronto was pretty cool once again .
time , i was about to call jason ... ... ..
we got split into groups , with jt and kendrick taking me , calvin , mike and dan .
turns out his green light button is red .
and probably went beyond .
kinda interesting how mood swings happen ... ...
slept lol .
after the study came rec !
so after the elections , headed to class for last 5 minutes , and then 2nd period .
friendster .
watching the water go by while swimming ... ...
since she 's past the 5 foot mark now lol ... .
well badminton season last year lol .
march break lol .
we up at cambridge this year .
forearm freeze , elbow , pikes , airchair .
maybe i 'll take like marketin or something in summer school .
the marvelous talent of via cooks =p .
i saw rebecca , caitlin and sarah l. looking at ... ..
3 points !
wow our school actually has friggin nice instruments .
well he was still sleeping .
he would arrive around 15 minutes late ... .
i really am thinkin ' bout takin ' science all through my high school career ... .
i met up w/ spencer , igor , and dan to session .
but he related much of this to apostle paul , as he was one of the most talked about missionaries in the new testament .
well at least in my point of view .
we ate and talked .
sermon today unfortunately still had abit of aftermath from the earlier things , so i did n't really pay attention , and used the time more for reflection ... .
adam assumed we were supposed to let them write the answers down and first person to hand in all the right answers wins .
ended up going to mr. sub , which actually is n't too bad .
daniel trinh if you ever get to read this props man ...
friggin amazing ok today 's entry i 'm just going to skip right until after school .
yeah i was wired .
actually before i say what happens you might wan na close your eyes or something to skip this part .
so i guess i 'll say until either tomorrow or the day after tomorrow ... ..
i think that came in just because i watched prime time abc .
not much happened .
english class we started watching romeo and juliet .
4/10/04 ergh ... .
oh yeah ... .
i sound good enough ... .
was n't too bad though ... .
intermediate band .
and to my not-so-surprised self everyone was there at the bbq already .
* and then hammond told this one funny story about him lol .
you know who you are out there ... .
yay math class .
competition .
so yeah i 'm officially settled back into my slow-paced hick life ... ..
download some music you people .
other than that `` saddening '' event ... ...
me , calvin , and gavin played some ball mostly for the whole time , ranging from 3-on-3 to 4-on-4 to other stuff that resembled basketball *american 21 for example .
after i woke up from a 30 minute nap this happened : mitch : joe move i got ta get some stuff joe : ok *why does the chair feel different ?
-bio : got tests back .
wait a minute !
that one caused her to throw stuff at john though lol .
like why da heck americans seem to think the answer of why their country is violent is because of a bloody history .
did n't really hit much .
entertaining , fun , and of course work *shudder .
yay !
so i kinda did n't grasp the message today =s .
programming : final evaluation .
the jersey that almost every kid has even though philly sucks .
whoo .
we all seem to be pretty lazy people lol .
ugh stupid clock fooling me ... ..
the whole fight scene was hilarious ... .
but it 's for the best that they do leave since it is god 's will .
or the thing about `` ok ... .
whatever the hell his name was ... ..
well then twice .
did a physics test today .
lounged around for a bit ... ..
at least my pupils are almost back to normal size ... .
but yeah he was kinda put on the spot there .
arthur is another b-boy , gloria vikki and jenny were hilarious , and clarence ...
and then morning routine ...
by now you should know i do n't have a mat since mine broke !
well ... ... ...
not very exciting ... ...
yeah i realize what i said ... ..
so no sign of him at subway where we were gon na meet , so we went to eb since we thought he 'd be there .
we got to his house probably around 3:15 and were met by a box of donuts and well ... ...
pretty boring stuff .
* and now i 'm sitting in ms. fallon 's guidance office .
it was totally far out . ''
much more jokes and fun .
it was cool .
final score : 15-12 or something like that .
normal .
sorta=p .
until his ally packing snow came ...
g'nite .
i mean the most action packed thing was thompson raising the question of why asians are considered to be yellow .
plus i think now that that would be the last time i 'll see ali as part of hype .
it was really good presentation though ... ..
40 minutes ?
we 'll make it sound better .
josh today was on bass in worship .
totally unforgettable .
i 'm now officially done !
all i remember is a flash of movies , some kick ass sitcoms *family guy* and of course ... ... .
the bottom line : keep my horizon broad .
boooooo !
i was pretty apolegetic about it ... .
maybe if luck gives me a smack in the face i can get em @ semi =p .
service was pretty quiet today .
then took a few secs to recuperate ...
whoo hoo .
then this would drag on through into math class .
i did n't actually get any like new things out of the film .
* first off ... ... .
and my presentation did n't go to waste *phew !
but then i thought this is kind of like saying my church is a place to look at ... ..
hit me .
originally wendy was supposed to come too but our car ran outta space .
*sigh* to think conni , ali and mike are leavin ' ... ...
in fact it 's helped me a lot , since i finally got some pointers on how to make my prayer life better/devo life .
half the class was kinda giggling 'bout it too .
i do n't know what the hell james and the other girl did ... ..
but i do n't know why ... ..
there 's my math skills for you hehe .
no more radiation !
i had my black one and he had his red one .
my pupils are still immense ... ...
and after 45 miutes of eating ... ..
i mean first of all it 's a blog i 'm writing in .
this week has just been awesome .
i had to play a practice match today w/ john and two girls because ms. bates made us ... .
when everyone was sitting in desks and mr. g was already writing stuff on chalkboard .
so my class spread out over many rooms and started to practice a bit , preparing our solos for june .
same result .
what are our talents ?
productive no ?
mike and john got their usual burger and breakfast ( food goes in order w/ names ) .
oh yeah and the face jokes haha .
grr ... ..
hopefully .
weird lol .
well after chattin ' for a bit n ' stuff , finally london ontario .
yeah that got most of the class cracking ... ...
pretty funny though , me and dan kept going back to the burns and punching/shoving into lockers as our usual greetings .
but also of course ... ... ..
another thought that popped up i guess *as of every other baptism i 've attended* i started to wonder `` when will it be my time ? ''
which got bronze .
ok i wo n't lie i ca n't help it sometimes ... ... .
ok you get the point !
pretty fun i guess .
read ... ...
but honestly not as frequent .
we 've been having jupah for the past 4 nights and i 'm really getting sick and tired of it .
but i was n't really there for the larger portion of the workshop , so unfortunately i ca n't say much about it .
i kinda jumped in and asked `` am i late ? ''
so g'nite ... .
yeah ... .
so off me and gavin and steph went to help with children 's sunday school ...
then i found out she is actually a eurodance fan .
lol then nate used mitch 's joke on thompson *he 's american : * nate : hey thompson stick out your arm *thompson sticks out arm* *nate hits it* thompson : wth ?
wump !
for lunch ...
*stunned look someone 's capable of being that stupid* wow ... ... ..
the final class of the day which i 'll summarize very quickly ... .
well supposedly more people were there but i did n't see em .
and all i got was a sandwich and a aluminum can of carbonated sugar water .
instead of 5-piece i do 4-piece set .
everyone else just arrived too hehe .
another sc player lol .
but after 5 mins david started listening to music also .
well ... .
oh well anyways ...
we got wrecked lol .
kinda weird .
i mean sacrificing your life for your religion is pretty deep .
i really got to know the captains pretty well .
have n't seen her since ... ... .
mike got a bite back in the ass from when he pushed thompson yesterday ...
but then again i normally anticipate exams and big tests waay too much than it actually is .
had some fun times there ... ...
so yeah we kinda started getting ready slowly .
we were fairly organized with it ... ..
i 'm actually sorry if i cause any distruption ... ... ..
wow i feel tall though ...
basically it happened in real slow motion .
cya .
and off to home i went .
all these weird noises were coming out of my compy .
apparently one mansion has an indoor pool , outdoor pool and skating rink .
5 more classes of dictatorship ... ... .
whoo no school =p .
when i prayed for most of it ... .
meh .
i realized i forgot something else .
apparently it 's a boston shooting shirt ?
mmmm .
besides the fact my perimeter shot is horrible i also took my glasses off after being whapped in the face by the ball twice and them staying intact , i took them off to avoid any further damage .
but it 's really cool to see dan , mike and jason already grow so much in christ .
i now really know what `` doing my devos '' really means ... .
*two hours later* `` i awoke two hours later , dazed and confused in the dark ...
drummed so much my arms began to hurt lol .
and now i go study and watch ncaa finals !
so yeah ... ...
i guess .
cya .
yet be defeated by words of god when gavin prayed for it to leave .
kept me awake at least .
of course much more detailed : -music : learning minor scales though i already know them like a chinese restaurant owner knows dim sum -science : bio test .
spent a good one hour studying mark 12 after reading a section in pdl which led me to read my bible then .
math ... ... .
lol .
well apparently we were n't gon na go see last samurai anymore *whoo hoo movie time comes through and foils plan .
the drumming was sick , and dave 's blaring on the trombone was really good .
we sounded pretty good i thought ... ..
and alex really does try his hardest it seems ... ..
with christian questions since we are in a church .
whatever happened to writing thanks or thank you ?
bused w/ stefan , then transferred on to wonderland .
wonder if i 'll even see em @ tc ... .
in like the 200 churches or something in our london area , there are always empty pews .
and also just the final worship ... ...
civics class i typed up my essay on jfk .
most likely .
it 's a nice shirt though , looked it up on foot locker .
when we got kicked out ... .
girl : oh thanks ... ..
* after that we took notes *how uncommon is that ?
so i quickly rush upstairs ... .
may christ keep on shining within in you guys in whatever future paths you may step into .
normally kids will just walk to wherever they are going .
that was directed to you ... .
so far it 's lookin like this : friday : good friday church service , then badminton , then workin ' out saturday : do n't know yet ... ..
no classes today ... .
fun though =p .
by the way if you do n't know why i 'm saying the 1st joseph it 's because he could fortell dreams , and the actual story does have a bit more sadness in it .
cya .
our first point !
anaheim was in 8th last year for the playoffs and they made detroit look like the penguins .
surprisingly early .
complaining about the corruption of kiwanis , and the fact that i flunked a bio test .
dipping it in *dip dip* you then rinse it off *rinse rinse* and then shove it onto the machine *erk erk .
well anyways first thing we did in civics ... ..
bean style .
then he decided to put the flame into a pop bottle .
wow most anti-gavin guitar bashing i 've ever heard courtesy of victor and vince lol .
so went home ... ... .
sweet 2 bucks a slice of pizza !
my hair isnt turned into hat hair .
but randomly nate pushed thompson into the snow .
whoo how action packed ... .
my lesson like usual was a lecture about how i should practice 525 minutes a week .
2nd , 3rd , then 5th place .
thompson the quake freak just ran around on the beachhead *normandy level* and shot up everyone with panzershrecks and machine guns and grenades .
and the story of how one senator only went to work 12 times in 10 years and still got paid the same 70,000 a year plus a 10,500 tax free allowance and 64 free first class air tickets to anywhere in canada .
motivation for myself =p .
lots of talking n stuff .
went home .
ate some lunch ... .
but then after realizing they would n't come around this time in the afternoon ... ..
badminton today : hmm ... ... ..
ate a granola bar+a snickers , downed with nothing else but gatorade ... ..
bio class !
so seeing it ... .
finally started our meeting for hype planning .
i 'll just leave you with my cheesy slogan taken from sprite : '' image is nothing ...
whoops ?
tonight i pulled off two windmills again .
so ate a quick breakfast , and then headed out the door ... ... .
wth where are they ! ?
the bass trombone i had was basically brand new .
but the other crew responded with another routine of this guy controlling the other guy breakin ' basically .
and another few i do n't understand why they are in gr .
no abc learn for me !
talked bout random crap , thompson still used the n word a lot ... .
lol .
then ... ... ... .
honestly i would n't care if someone got bronze .
i mean at first i was like 'whoa the red ranger kicks ass ' but then the white ranger came along ... ... ...
not yourself , since this is something that only a power like christ can handle .
winter holdays were so relaxing , and now i got ta work again , and do stuff for school .
rain fall is getting to be a better and better book now ... .
but fun at times haha .
closed down though wonder why .
*slaps himself* yes ... ... .
we played some doubles ... .
he was a great speaker though .
well for 5 bucks ca n't complain ... ..
so now ... .
my life 's back on track now .
well after that i left for talent show around 6ish ... .
school propaganda ...
well eventually hammond caught up to us and greeted me with a friendly push into the snowbank .
* well on my way home , i called some people lol .
so me and amy in the end begun conducting the class , which was n't exactly the greatest thing in the world but hey we managed to get some work done lol .
quickly downed some food ... .
i really do n't care ... .
taking them home first .
pretty fun day hmm though saturday 's always start off groggy and slow , it ended off pretty well .
academically at least .
got to church around 9:10 ... ...
jokes jokes calvin ... .
we were 30 minutes late lol .
hmmm ... .
but ... ...
mike is slowly still attempting turtles ... ..
yes .
great time ... .
eventually i woulda stueid straight from 5:30-630ish .
but thanks to good old multi choice ... ...
eventually hiding behind my minivan in hopes the bumblebee is out of my testing area for lifeforms .
class would actually be amusing ... .
god just stood back ... .
last 100m before summer holidays !
if you did n't love god , you would n't go to church , keep the sabbath holy , or have him being the only god .
it 's an idea ... .
5/8/04 a productive day in the t-dot hmm ... ..
music class was really boring today ... .
cya .
geting 68 % on my stupid grafeq assignment .
*waking up at 7:30pm or so* the time from waking up till now has consisted of watching game 4 between calgary and tampa *where calgary is losing at the moment this blog was made grrr ...
boring .
ez things to bring up my mark .
by now i 'm like dead tired .
meh not that i can complain my mark is still very high .
just made first bell .
theory donut clinic # 2 for me : productive .
ugh ...
wow ... ..
it was good to have it so relaxing ... ...
*30 seconds later* times up here it goes =p .
i 'm becoming a napper myself now =p .
he sounds better than anton or jonny though =p .
but yeah today the main theme i got out of it was the `` multiple personalities '' part .
and then off to theory .
sorta .
there .
i was actually very surprised that i managed to still clinch 3rd .
so this morning headed to school with a smile on knowing `` in 6 hours ... ..
then the crucifying .
bloggin ' yet again .
me , dave , gavin and josh .
obey your thirst . ''
yeah ... ...
and actually congratulated me and john on our defense .
then off to first period ... ..
scrambled to find room 314 ... ... ...
got there perfectly on time .
not bad considering the quality ... .
anywho ... .
leap year day blog !
probably .
no lift for jason today ... ...
plus worship practice , and gym nite 2morrow ... .
we sucked ... ..
carmen , jason , josh .
my day like i said started at 8am today .
test tomorrow .
wow multitasking ... ...
crap !
we may have not had an amazing praise night ...
but my opinion is he was more towards peacekeeping , which i agree .
ok ... ..
you may not see it with the naked eye , but under the light you can see it perfectly .
it sucks and plus i changed it anyways .
mrs. wharton !
wow as it good .
*4 hours later* woke up , ate , played some ball at paul 's old place and then sced for a bit .
same crap that it plays any other time in london .
so boring and stupid .
he as a pretty cool teacher .
originally we started off with a regular defense , but then for some reason we had an excess amount of gas and no minerals .
says to them the 4 of them are pretty pathetic as dave rutt ( stage band x conductor/senior trombonist ) could produce more sound than them alone .
instead of setting it forward ... ...
hehe at least something 's going right today in the sports world = ) .
not much happened in music today .
bell rang ... .
yes shut up i realize that i need both .
we would continue on on sunday and monday , but for today we were finished .
just ours .
you win probably once every ... ...
like ... ... ..
umm ... ... .
also sadly josh was the one that explained it and he 's been livin ' the least amount of time in london and knows more than gavin lol .
or not .
with the nailing to the cross and of course the pain that goes along with it .
but i can sure as hell image better than josh at the moment .
teacher : tommy do you see the tree outside ?
nothing too exciting happened .
sun 's shining already .
but honestly smarten up at times lol .
*kinda doubtful look* are you sure .
and saw another dude from central team there steve zhao .
that all changed though ... ..
hahaha nothing can be worse than thompson 's picture though ... .
school wise n stuff ... ...
it 's already the end of the uwo school year .
some of them were amazing *lindsay 's group and tehmina 's group had crazy ones* and also another two gr .
god i know you 're with me ... ...
after two and a half months , watching more blogs pop up , and etc. , i seem to be the lone survivor of blogging .
though i have to wake up an hour early it 's worth it .
it was cold !
yeah it was pretty boring as you can see .
this morning we had a 1.5 hour rehearsal , though it was a late start day , but regardless i still had to be at school by 730am .
then back we went into kendrick 's crayonmobile *it smells like crayons for some reason .
do n't have to suffer in the same place for over two hours .
talked about a few things in our church , and just reflected about may camp .
random crap about stuff that does n't even matter ... .
and then decided to read psalm 23 tonight .
but on my perspective of the afternoon ... ..
*sigh .
i 've also come to like public speaking now through this .
i 'm feelin ' a lot better now compared to other days as i 'm not as sick , and i felt a lot better with my new prescription glasses today and did n't feel like i was going to puke .
at one point was jetta tdi , then protege 5 , mazda6 , mazda tribute , ford excursion ...
at least easter is during april ^_^ .
of which i will do at belle-air soon .
i 'm just thankful that he 's got back to his senses now .
this verse really hit me ... .
he can play the snare better than the drummers in my school .
i find room 2028 ... ..
later =p .
unfortunately some exciting one 's i ca n't remember *blasted short term memory grrrr .
i was thinkin santa cruz @ one point ... ..
so happy avs won ... ... .
music class ... ... ..
only got 5 hours of sleep left technically .
i 'd just rather see the senators win .
well anyways after school , met up w/ igor and dan for a after school session .
anyways i 'm out for the night now , so watch out for my next entry coming thursday march 11th .
but i think you people should get this movie ... .
shouts =p .
amazingly when he said he would pray for anyone , the first person that came up was this alcoholic student .
and mega props to martha cap 's and counselor and kids=p .
i mean though he was a good music teacher , i never really liked him .
just found out mophead 's meal everyday would normally cost 4 bucks for me ... .
well now that i 'm done ... ..
ranging from chicks to star trek ... ..
romeo and juliet is hilarious when people in your class read it .
so ate that ... .
beat dan once !
this is almost as weird as marcello knowing my cousin .
also got history test of the dirty 30 's back ...
i 'm still a bit confused , but as the night is going by *it 's 1am now* i think i 'm starting to get a clearer vision of this .
as mentioned , in no time we were at the heritage college place in cambridge .
i actually talked for a while , then i ended up running out the door when i was stopped by steph bourdage .
that was when we then stumbled on 12 boxes of cup noodles *aka bui mein .
jason beat me 1 on 1 ... ..
well not a bit , more like an hour of talking and then prayers lol .
while sitting there ... ... .
actually mostly the 1st chapter .
so yeah that was goal # 2 .
only previews for one movie instead of the usual 7 .
so i got to school late .
thompson got a free refill from my double cup ... .
since i have no aim whatsoever with a hockey stick lol .
everything from cars , to stuff about life and of course just stupid stuff that i do n't remember that well now lol .
when i say this i do n't mean like `` oh no everything 's going wrong '' i mean it more of a `` finally life 's back to its average self . ''
left the house around 12:55 after lunch ... .
stupid snow .
unfortunately they did n't accept debit uner 5 bux , so i had to buy something else .
dunno if it 's maturity level or the fact a bible helps this much ... .
i think i 'm a bit of a ham ... ..
well while surfing blogs just now ... ...
4/26/04 one more kiwanis event to go ... ..
happy calgary won last night ...
radio was talking about hockey games from last night ... .
i was really nervous .
i really got ta boost my creativity skills up =p .
the whole thing about `` who 's going to go to heaven and who wo n't . ''
or maybe i just like to think about things like this .
but yeah science ... ..
me and age went back in forth while marcello and daniel stayed on the old chairlift hills .
thompson was dressed as a `` wanksta '' with a tambourine around his head .
wow .
wow ... ..
i just noticed that .
least he was n't in a pissed-off mood ... ... .
and warmed up ... .
gon na go do some stuff like piano , sc , sleep , eat , then session .
crap .
funny how tc emphasizes `` no macking '' so much lol .
how would i have ever gotten closer to christ ?
but i think so since also we got some hefty ground covered for praise night .
now nate and shawn can mock the me and the senators for losing .
i was terribly bored .
you know that sandy ... .
and sleep looks very tempting hehe .
fits theme really well hehe .
and once again i will be using the same format for mass blogging like i have with tc and huntsville .
but anyways here 's the summary on the rest of my day .
i was actually keeping track in my bible and everything ... .
it was n't actually too bad weather this morning though ...
but did n't as he thought it might `` offend '' adam .
and off to piano lessons ...
but yeah ... ..
i had fried rice today .
sweet .
but yeah ... ... .
but noooooo i 've gone to one already .
if i can lol .
maybe years =s .
oh well ... ..
i 'm actually beginning to like the sound we produce ... ... .
these last few days i 've been averaging 5 hours of sleep a night ... ... .
trigonometry is n't that hard .
i think we were supposed to get a transfer but i did n't really care since bus driver was a smurf .
lots of candy ... ..
hmm ... ..
10 's .
4/1/04 april fool 's day : was it playing a joke on me @ badminton ?
plus ... .
lunch went to jasper 's .
i knew most of the stuff on the exam .
harlem .
obviously you can just do one sometimes ... .
reluctant to leave bed !
lots of sleeping well in the morning ... ...
and tin cans for speakers .
so ate there , walked back , and played the 30 seconds of ball i was there for and then the bell rang .
it 's 11:42pm right now , i 'm sick , huddled under a blanket in front of my comp , so my blog 's gon na be brief today : -woke up with a scratchy throat , thinking i may be sick -school -history test ... ...
i mean really , i can still go to semi next year and gr .
today was also day 1 of recovering from the last two days where i have been a bit sick , and also today i wrote my english exam essay thing ; wonder how that turned out =s .
then bus ride home .
i guess i 'd never think about having a thing like that at a church ... ... ..
and gerty 's cousin helped me get my life back on track ?
s'all good i 'll cram the night before =p..
me : clarence : *takes out a wooden pole* machine gun *bak bak bak* joe : *look at him with a stunned look* someone 's more retarted than me ? !
we started with a video , and then some people gave speeches .
yeah savouring the previews to this afternoon 's bbq day for my english service ... .
so decided to take long way there instead of waiting for dundas bus *patience right there* and took cherryhill w/ dan and elaina , then transfered onto wonderland .
i thought it was but then jason told me it was interaction time ... ... ...
and someone yelled forrest gump .
bio is n't really that appealing when ms. wiener gives you a test about the crap we 've done since september .
just how direct and how quickly the lord answered me ... .
well the music test was a joke ...
that woulda killed .
there are some decent 9ers actually ... ... ..
nothing against mike he 's cool but the other two ... .
piano lesson : got ta catch up on theory ...
took up a sheet of fill in the blanks , and stuff ... .
english class .
so yeah my weekends are normally spent outside my house anyways .
argh .
props for sure for that .
my stats for my best game was 6 pts , 7 assists , and 5 blocks .
yeah dude *justin deyell* get a life .
maad props .
yes i was still hungry , and gavin was also ...
yes way =p .
oh yeah and with the constant pictures of sim city 4 paul keeps sending me ... .
and then to science .
so yeah , left for pat 's house for a ride to school @ 7:40 .
science class ... ... .
just to think that school starts in a matter of two days ... ..
no homework or anything today too lazy to do any ...
one thing though i 'm happy for is the fact that mrs. wharton actually gave me opportunity to play in this band ... .
turns out she woke up late and forgot to get a ride from someone ... ..
and today ... ... .
i headed to my piano lessons , since yesterday they got rescheduled to today .
is the biggest thing im worried about right now .
but anyways the main point is there were lots of good battles , and i really thought that paying 5 bux for this ... ...
actually today at church was pretty fun ...
then josh came down for his lunch also and chatted for a bit .
got real big hopes on em hahaha *pressure 's ondudes .
i kinda hit crickets ... .
too bad my group presents first day back =\ .
thompson got usual breakfast , mike got burger and nate a bagel .
at first the stench of the hearts were unbearable ... .
`` purpose driven life '' i 'm slowly getting through now at least ... .
if i could get one of those timers ... ...
or prayer to god ... .
i kinda fell asleep slowly , but we were all dismissed for our seminars just in time , so no i did n't catch any shut-eye yet .
time for stage band x practice .
gloria was just telling me about how some koreans get their eyelids surgically enlarged ... .
who cares if we lost ... .
which is where i 'm leading to now .
which is good .
they actually have a chance at the cup now i think .
* also , and our whole congregation sang `` happy birthday '' for her lol .
but chinese=p .
but that was my fault *though i wish our church would get high speed* and i was the one that volunteered for the responsibility .
buses do n't have enough horsepower to make it up a hill lol .
so we ended up sitting there for an hour ... .
and realizing i woke up later than expected i rushed around the house , crammed the very final few minutes i could and then ran out the door , multitasking of cramming , drinking tea and listening to music .
well worship did n't go bad today .
yeah ... ... .
but quickly got back on track .
amazing .
better running ?
also , while waiting at my bus stop today though ... .
but with more bling bling and cooler moves lol .
so after 40 minutes of class me , dave and pokan got to leave early for the spring teams assembly .
he sucks at badminton =p .
prayers please for that ... .
you can see both god 's power and mercy from that action .
i do n't blame them ... .
so excited !
kills any of william 's food .
english class ... ..
technically friday morning posting up this blog .
but i heard from jason yao and the rockets are killin ' lakers right now .
ca n't wait 'till then ... .
or the first time you open up the pig ...
i actually reallly find this workshop so far really useful .
lol ... ..
john terry and adam crookes are just too friggin ' annoying .
oh there was a lot of sick combos , but i ca n't describe em .
normality can seem to be such a precious commodity .
pushing me back to 3rd ... ..
like i 'd actually do that =p .
but anyways ... ... ..
my day started off at a healthy 730 once again today ...
wow how boring a friday is .
well more like plummeted away very quickly when mr. mccumber entered the room .
and now ... ...
this morning many technical difficulties from many of us .
or even exceed it .
dunno why but lately i 've come to take an interest in imaging w/ adobe .
`` *coughrebeccacough !
calvin pulled nice crickets too , and some freezes .
i think i 've covered everything i want to cover .
english was amusing .
so i 'll just zip through *sc sc , drum , eat , scsc , drum , zzzzzzzzzz* and it 's now 1:30 .
i had to stay in n e ways though ... ... .
yes i remember how to play it and surprisingly after the results came in ... ...
he set his clock because i kinda reminded him last night .
i hate you too !
also i just hope that her life will improve period .
i was surprised that dan could almost hold airchair now .
i bet you 're surprised too .
gloria : what 's the base number ?
for now ... ..
day ?
and they were n't there .
we finally got it hehehe .
pretty good series though i 'll bet ... ..
me and hammond ended up studying for chem exam next wednesday .
thanks jason by the way .
up until now i still hate arpeggios with a passion .
we watched a video .
i did 60 today ( not full effort but meh ) , but over the summer i did over 60 with a 25 pound weight .
so after 15 minutes of driving or so , got to school .
then we got really bored ... ...
and off to science .
cya .
surfed net .
*apparently 5/300 gr .
then dad mentioned it was wendy 's birthday today *happy bday wendy !
still brainstorming an idea .
wow .
which was friggin hilarious ... .
some of the stuff i 'm not that familiar with like i kinda forgot how to do ionic bonding .
wow it was a bit of a waste lol .
sc , piano practice , etc etc .
* math class ... ..
same as stage band x ... ..
ow .
i really just improvised .
now i 'm leaving for ucc .
romeo and juliet can be a funny play when you compare some words used then for good w/ words used now w/ a bad meaning or sound like it *ho , chink , knave , etc .
i really liked the sermon today ... .
i would then give one to jason too ... .
*baung !
then after all other groups were done ...
by the time i got out it was 6pm .
wow .
well at first i did n't notice it ... ..
actually ... ...
in fact this is gon na probably stick in my head for a long time .
well my mom took the minivan w/ josh 's stuff to ucc , and well my dad was taking us in the honda .
once again i zoned out at the wrong time and misheard the instructions ... ..
so we ate , cereal and macaroni with ham once again , but no muffins or croissants this time = ( .
he reffered to the bishop in `` les miserables '' a lot .
but it was pretty boring .
then again tc is about knowing god more ... .
so when getting back up to our rooms , we just did research for our projects .
*trumpet blasts/drumroll* 2/19/04 in the beginning ... ..
so yeah by now i 've taken probably 40 pics already , deleted a lot of crappy ones lol .
with the whole competition thing .
note taking .
now off to lunch ... ... .
and now ... ..
yeah history zoomed by sorta ... ..
also packin ' still tonight for 2morrow ... .
it was actually pretty fun today and we are starting to sound good .
yeah it 's unfortunate .
though half the teams i wanted in never got in .
grabbed school crap *and jason 's controller and nfsu for his house after school* and bolted out the door .
oh yeah got theory test back .
first it 's a team that has always sucked until recently so i feel sorry for someone to be actually wearing that jersey .
i did n't eat anything ...
yeah i 'm too lazy to make a good post ... .
later .
yeah basically we are saying you 're cut ! ''
i also apparently made my piano teacher panic cuz she seems to think someone in grade 8 piano should practice 575 minutes a day ?
but it was kinda cool .
50 pounds of meat ... ... ... .
well yeah today we started working on projects right away .
got course selection booklet , application form , etc etc .
a book that flips back and forth between depression 30 's and a retirement home with a crazy woman that talks 24/7 about random stuff and a depressed woman who eats a lot .
yeah i 'm out for the night .
holy crap the burgers at mcguiness are good .
however `` thirst is everything '' reminds me of how longing to build up your relationship w/ christ is everything .
the movie showed the hitlter youth camps , and wow ... ..
lunch ...
so ... .
lucky i was n't included , or else it would be 5 =p .
or a green one .
then drove down to lina 's then jason 's ... .
mmm ... .
aftermath of sleeping @ 230am : i woke up about 11am =p .
omg there is christian dance music !
we would all then go in , and wait for josh .
but does n't matter ... ...
chinese new year dinner .
we were planning a teddy bear to play mercutio lmao .
then went again lol .
that 's basically my afternoon .
then annoucements .
mr. mccumber played sorta a `` farewell '' thing .
this time i managed to stay awake through most of it .
yeah i do realize i 'm still on a hockey aftermath from the `` spiritual hat-trick '' thing but meh i like hockey ... .
with controllers .
4 singers and one instrument .
slept .
well i remember the story .
whoo !
but honestly i really do n't like playing against those music-geeky asians that seem to think mozart is still metallica and beethoven is 50 cent .
in the semi finals ... ..
wendy got the front all spiked up , and becca ... .
every year around this time ... ...
slept through some video about endangered species .
i hope this lesson helped some of the new people *or n00bs as brian k called em lol* that have just recently started coming to our church .
funny how it came about .
badminton stuff , music stuff , school stuff , other stuff ... .
er # 2 under piano lol .
yeah i bet you recognize that slogan ... .
first time ... .
l-a-m-e. our ideas are pretty cool though .
i 'm actually considering taking it again maybe next year ... ..
we have very artistic people in our class ...
and no waiting this time .
though my day did n't end off too well ... ...
do n't know if final outcome was for the best ... .
so yeah before i knew it service was over ... .
well today was n't too bad though ... ..
amazed it happened in the aftermath of tc .
anywho ... .
and like i said before it postpones tc .
if i set it high ... ..
actually it was a first .
quiet walk lol .
cya .
very few things =p .
basically their footrest was non-existent .
ms. manson was n't convinced that 8 lbs of rice could last a week .
rambo poser i realize=p .
with all that into play , i was in school today for a total of ... ...
hmm turns out lots of people are going for jr. and sr. badminton .
well eventually my strength would come back .
really busy sorry again dudes and dudettes ...
mmm ... ..
left for hype around 6:00 .
and it 'll be my first sports game .
well anyways yeah , i 'm now watching some of the pro bowl and grammy 's at the same time .
i mean this as in i seem to be the only one still blogging daily .
after the exam , quickly ran out the door excited about going to toronto .
hehehe .
when i saw it for the first time *er noticed it more like* my first thought : `` o m g i 'm going to this dump for dinner on saturday ? ''
well i was gon na go work on my bio project ... ... ..
whoo 19/20 ... ..

and got right down to business .
badminton practice !
hmmm i lost my bag .
but it was funny ... .
jenn .
but 40 minutes passes by quickly ... ..
maybe it 's because ... .
but for some reason i kept thinking i forgot something ... ..
like mike n ' dan have also been growing which i commend them for , but jason has been taking this stuff in surprisingly quick .
well i may be the only person that understands my own thoughts .
12 i heard you get to cut up a full sheep .
thompson tried on glasses ... ..
hey well worth it ...
a baloon expanded from air pressure ... ...
monday : no clue at all ... ..
actually it was starving every once in a while ... ..
came math .
just the content ... .
but yeah it 's good at least my eye doctor did n't just go `` oh you have this prescription now . ''
oreos+ ketchup chips .
after that ... .
also it helps me w/ my memory *got the idea from buttefly effect i guess , but it works* and also my english writing skills have actually gone up .
band went through a quick runthrough ... .
plus more work than usual .
but , you can still change your way from how the previous humans programmed .
still got ta do a review though .
gavin 's as good as subdividing as he is at badminton ( burn ! ) .
other than the fact i can escape this blasted hicktown that i live in ... ..
seriously that is what i call random .
but some parts are hilarious even though it is an action movie .
tell me when so i can start punching you in the gut again '' or : `` hey mrs. wharton ...
we managed to put ourselves on the board !
have a good one =p .
but yeah ... .
umm oh yeah from before i finally realize red wings are out of the playoffs *nice* and the flames now go on to play either san jose or colorado *better be the avs ... .
`` you 're an asshole . ''
and here 's the day : -woke up -lift to school from pat -history ... .
like usual i woke up at 6 , did usual morning routine ... .
that was my morning ...
if you loved someone you would n't lie , steal , or kill them .
i machine gunned him ... .
what a feat for a camera ... .
or someone should have if not us *so bland when everyone gets silver* and headed back to saunders .
now to suffer the rest of the day half blind ... .
oh well least i still have $ $ $ to spend =p .
it started raining outside .
well until after history class .
hmm ... ..
got 73 % on one and 80 % on the other .
but yeah just hope they are careful with it and use it with the right aim .
and then after that we went on with the rest of our program .
porkchops ... ...
lol .
mom had gone to dragon court to pick some up ... .
easy piece -got a ride to masonville to pick up project materials -underhill came over and we finished most of project up -built rollin ' colon and rectal rangers , and tooth booth ( i 'll post pics tomorrow ... .
huh ?
and caitlin 's belly flopping *wth ? !
these last three days have really been a blessing .
but yeah after all that wasted time with some productivity ... ...
* after our class finally got the joke .
i really do n't know how those uwo kids find so many songs ... ..
the inside is actually pretty sweet ... ..
who knows maybe steph rents out the basement to uwo students or sometin .
civics class .
but when he sat down ... .
though i just printed them off the project .
this is some of the best spiritual growth i 've seen happen at my church in years .
it was cool .
but i think it got rejected .
well after jason finally got a chance to read since everyone else left , we had to leave ... .
my prayers do go out to cecilia zhang 's family right now as today they found her dead in missisauga .
you know salutation , body paragraph , and closing .
but what kinda manga would it be w/out the nerdiness ?
great feeling when you see another bro or sister of christ or even just a random person walk away with their problem solved .
oh yeah and a few multi choice too , but was n't too worried about that .
then time for final interactions .
squared !
wow melum 's team kicked the crap outta the other team 23-8 .
then i got off @ beckers and mom drove me home .
they 'll be just as exciting with my milling around toronto .
cuz i mean ... .
like i said music was very boring today .
well yeah thought i 'd add that ... .
ugh wo n't be able to sleep though from a 4 hour nap ...
anyways we got in , sat around in the auditorium , and then the conference started .
well tired .
* wait is that a good or bad thing =p .
it 's about 945 now .
one thing that really still sticks in my mind is the quote that pastor mackness said about how `` spiritual life can interfere with physical life , but physical life ca n't interfere with spiritual life . ''
we then chose some songs ... ... ...
friggin cell phone did n't work *damn fido ... ...
yeah but overall ... .
so i hope people do n't take it as though if you do n't have an x , c , o , or w/e in front of his/her name ... ..
me and calvin used half a bottle of gel in pau pau 's hair ... ..
in detail .
er me and josh did so i could send her directory and that was the last of the studies .
i kick off my year by flicking to porno by accident and with everyone just staring at a 60 '' gargantuan projector screen .
funny as hell though .
and wow was it cool ... ..
so i thought it was smart to tell her to move to the left so we would n't be blocking the people that may want to use the other one ... .
i get to do a whole assignment on jfk .
* so i 'm stuck with ... .
ugh ... ..
then walked in the pouring rain back home .
lol bio class is so messed up ... ... ..
and to think that now ... .
gloomy days bring slow production .
so by the time we were done eating , we downed 3 cases of bui mein lol .
was pretty much done anyways .
but yah , now i have a math midterms comin up ... ...
so after all that jabbering ... .
how i envy p4 comps now ... ..
and we 'd all have hemorrages and die ... .
rats .
but sometimes she can lecture for 70 fulll minutes ... ..
not as much effort as before ... .
but most of my time consisted of playing ball and fooseball and pool and volleyball lol .
so difficult to come up with pros for an issue you are always against *i. e. same sex marriage* unfortunately i had to support this issue being the `` government , '' but it 's so hard .
played a bit of sc ... .
anyways i 'm out for the night .
i almost got pushed in at lunch but instead of falling in i somehow managed to land in the knee high snow on my feet and ran back out of the snowbank .
well today was n't so bad i guess .
made like 3 shots lol .
food .
bio had some laughs .
for day 1 lol .
today was n't bad actually ... ..
but before that ... ...
props to all who read this and are part of team maaaffaaaaa !

2/26/04 day two of being half blind ... ..

blast i lost .
class average ... ... ..
our group concluded that in leadership ... ...
she said my eyes were like overworked or sometin .
very boring stuff .

things have really been flowing as well as water flowing through a river .
like the dodge stratus i knew was a car and its a low value car , and stratus clouds are low level clouds .
but it was just sometin ' that i never felt before .
vertical compression and stretch he flipped around .
repetitive things can benefit on the occassion..
bused home ... .

what da hell ever happened to the teacher actually standing up there and teaching ?
so i had to put something over my compy so the rain wo n't fry it *if it does* and stowed it away in the back of the car .
i 'd just like to end w/ proverbs 24:17-18 .

oh yeah and the documenting lina 's `` clarinet practice . ''
also corn pops do n't randomly fire out like a bullet from the bottom of the cereal box ... ..
lol felt like pizza delivery boy for a bit since i had to caarry the stuff .
then during tithes offering , i had a quick prayer about my dream .
but it is really cool how god set up this event ... .

so i chatted around with gerty for a bit , then met up with gavin and david and picked up my tc 2004 shirt .
plus a killer soundtrack .
so being me , i had the honours of doing the first cut ^_^ and afterwards ben would help out a lot actually .

the bird goes to other side and we get a point !
by the way i 'm talking about the nhl if you still do n't know what i 'm talking about .
i 'm back to usual self ... .
while i was fighting on the ground ... ..
i had ever heard myself speak .
hype 's now two years old ... .
then in the end i kinda thought `` hmm ... ... .
`` mr. clark what have i ever done ? ''
that is classified .
we did work .
and golf 's a sport .
but wow the game on our side was pretty one-sided .
nor did mitch or anyone .
we had caesar sald and this unidentified salad *i think it 's greek* but no one took any .
so really ca n't blog exactly .
he lives out there .
a lot .
reason a i blame on no prayer of guidance ... ... ..
forgot i had brunch hehehe .
wow do i feel proud right now ... ..
fun move .
and then the final act with dave rutt and this crazy drummer that thompson told me was mark .
8 for badminton 2morrow lol .
anyways yeah so they did a presentation , some pretty funny skits , and then rec time !
turns out the heart has lots of holes .
a month ?
honestly having a battle near the end of session is n't the best time for me ... .
pulled off one decent elbow freeze in a battle ...
i mean i still remember at times in september where i would fall asleep while writing a note ... ...
slowly ... ... .
boooooooooooooooooooooooooorrrrrrrriiiiiiiinnnnnnnngggggggg .
i mean it started off with a debate w/ josh on whether d/l music is cool or not .
i was kinda finding it funny how our church retreat ... .
some beef something something .
boy only 3 more classes w/ mr. mccumber and then mrs. wharton comes back .
anyways back on topic .
causing him to spill his coffee all over himself* asians vs. americans ... .
and my car is faster now .
yeah like usual me mike nick and john led the loudness wars .
stage band x ... ..
skillz ... ... ... ..
the downside of free refills ... .
took a bit of a dip but s'all good ... ...
well ... ... .
oh well ate it anyways , and then went to chat more until lunch table calls started hehehe .
10 music ... ..
it took more than a week to build rome as they say .
idiot .
with attempts to snowbank nate .
lack of sleep ?
i mean naming 50 states ?
service was somewhat a slow moving one ... ..
so starvation for another hour lol .
if you were to ask me to interpret this ... ... ...
i 'm goin ' to belle air for music . ''
so did that until jason had to leave ... .
that 's ... ... .
hilarious lol .
ugh .
and then did usual morning routine and headed out the door with patrick .
well my morning started around 7:20am .
oh yeah my voice is slowly going by the second .
i have two particular dreams i remembered ... ... ... .
i really wish the kid good luck .
and this sorta ruins my snowboarding ambition for tomorrow .
my funny valentine or sometin like that ... .
last practice of the year for us before our big spring concert .
and off to mykono 's we go !
mmm food .
made him suffer going down flying dutchman on his first time ever skiing lol and made him literally paranoid on the chairlift when i was rocking the chair around .
we thought we 'd be late but we managed .
so yeah ... ... .
plus fried green tomatoes is kinda picking up also .
this russian somehow disguised himself as a german and was sent to hitler youth .
oh yeah ... .
wait ... .
was n't too pleased .
5/24/04 happy victoria day !
there was n't really any highlight ... ...
1920 's actually was a pretty cool era ... .
i 'm not about to wake up at 6am when i woke up at 11am yesterday ... ..
and apparently there are even some gr .
productive .
and being used to theory exams i took the full time plus extra time ... ... ... .
then off to bio we went .
it 's kinda like how we may not be able to see everyday christians ' doing ... .
well we are now trekking back *imaginination inserted here* back to school ... ...
and then now blogging .
sayonara .
for 4 months of attending church he really is accepting the message that god is giving him very well .
slowly .
well i 'm actually really concerned about selecting courses this year , seeing i only got two more years in high school .
well eventually we would make it out and i barely made it into class on time .
oh yeah i made a long distance call vai cell phone to jason , who was in toronto *whoops=p* now like i said ... ...
then went into bible study .
they had videos like `` how to become popular '' or `` how to date . ''
so with the traffic jam , i started singing to the songs i was listening to , mostly trance and of course the techno song by strong bad .
talked to brescia a hefty bit too ... .
though it was a day 2 , no worries =p .
also ... ... .
and pizza ... .
got ta still do devos too .
i got to the place around 3 , and picked it up .
yeah that would be a huge highlight ... ..
yes somehow i 've turned that into a graph picture .
afterwards though ... .
talked about so much .
if you readin this ... .
gr .
but mike seems hooked about it .
yeah and i wonder if avs are beating stars tonight ... ... .
and tomorrow i 'm waking up at 630 once again for senior band .
if i only had one i 'd unplug the piece of crap..
nothing really too great ... .
except more cuz after day 1 my voice was dying already lol .
he used the analogy of a shepherd .
namely the school song .
except for the fact of course anton 's uglier *burn !
it 's alright i guess ... ..
programming !
finlan won one game in mixed ... .
made thompson 's breakfast look like well ... ..
good times .
and then after that went home .
basically the video was showing how easy people conform to authority .
g'nite .
i really think my music class is getting more and more pathetic .
wee .
`` if the answer 's not right the first time damnit it 's not right the 2nd or 3rd time ! ''
school 's that is whoo hoo !
and had adrian over for a bit .
and then the playing of the wooden box with 88 keys ( 52 white keys and 36 black keys , which then equals 88 ) put into it with lots of wiring and felt hammers .
bio class was pretty lame .
hometime !
but anyways he 's a pretty crappy teacher .
i then called patrick to see if he wanted to play nfl street .
* later .
he likes using pictures though .
got so much crap to do the next while that it 's hard to keep up with my blogging lol .
yay !
i recommend anyone to see it .
we find out the top 9 teams through the `` kung fu endurance tests . ''
so when we got there ... .
quad meet attitude ?
and then we both went our ways since he had to go to uwo to find his dad to get home *his dad 's a professor there* and i walked back home with ryan ... .
11 's or 12 's .
did a decent job too ... ..
so yeah i woke up around 2pm , and then ...
anyways i finally made it for worship practice .
2/23/04 and the boredom of school strikes yet again ... .
john did n't go though and instead gave mike $ $ $ to buy john 's food to bring back .
just havin ' bot hthe priviledges of spiritual growth ... .
if i had coffee wow life would be much better .
it amused me nick and kyla for bout ... .
then he actually drinks through the bottle in a freeze .
i really need this for exam .
i mean ... ..
since i 'm gon na be a bit of a hermit doing all my h/w hehehehe .
wow i 'm really stressed out right now .
i basically wasted 10 bucks on the most clich
chow fan ... .
15 , then parents 5 , then uwo kids 40 , 2 pastors , and praise team .
which reminds me i still have n't typed out the request list .
* oh yeah and guilfoyle kinda came up with a good question too : who the heck really does read my blog ?
well after about an hour thompson left cuz he had a music exam ... ... ..
reminded me of last year .
yeah i 'm pretty hyped about it right now still , and just seeing how quickly time is flying by , wow .
good sign of summer i guess .
lol j/k wenders =p .
`` least we are good at something '' as josh said .
better pay attention you gon na be havin ' a quiz at the end of the day .
felt so weird seeing a fellow church member walk by , yet i ca n't even say hi since i do n't even know who she is .
especially the sarnia trip lol .
it 's really lame .
$ $ $ , food , and alcoholic drinks ... ... ..
ca n't believe hermann likes it .
so after that good old science class *shudder .
up against some familiar faces , one being arjun and the other being some girl ... ..
which leads to this little quote : connor : everyone shut up and listen to me !
programming ... ... .
arghhhh ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
and now i am going to go do other things .
for juniors i saw thompson , hermann , meaghan tanner , and thompson 's partner from last year jen .
i got out of lessons around 1pm ( 30 min lesson ) and then headed home and got stuff ready for snowboarding .
yeah today ... .
so yeah that made it pretty interesting actually .
i mean no offense to gavin but when he first came to church he really despised it it seemed like .
she wo n't notice will she ?
nothing else too exciting really .
eew .
first thing though , i was pleased to see some people replying to me and josh 's 4 page long email about hype in 2004 ... ... .
science courses are always so boring .
er writing right now , i am also listening to music , studying , and on msn .
well i 'm out for the night ... .
well after that i decided to tweak around on photoshop for a bit ... ..
well i think i did i doubt maisie even could figure out how ... .
now unfortunately i was pretty tired from the week , but that was n't a prime reason .
however sergei/lance and steve/will made it to round two .
well by the time i got back ... ...
diana and karen basically made my loud image look like a muffled bullhorn , and those two combined were ... .
unfortunately lindsay 's group 's powerpoint did n't work ... ..
all i need now ... ...
but other than that ... .
and today we also did some spreadsheet stuff .
uh ... ..
i pulled out my headphones and cd player and started listenin to some cd 's .
then finlan would make the shot .
and after band music ... ..
but i would recommend everybody , christian or non-christian to go see this production , and i hope that both ways it will make you think twice about what jesus has done for us .
not much variety of stuff but it 's got ta be done .
to a very unpleasant feeling of crappiness in the morning .
though i did n't have $ $ $ , jason covered for me ... .
* and heard much about ... ... ...
and then me and rob went to the library to start our bio project on malnutrition .
scary lol .
so after that then i started the bio and stayed up till 1am .
hehe yeah these last few days have been a blast though .
in the end i think jt and brian killed me and jason but we pulled off some pretty sweet stuff still lol .
like i said before my eye is still the size of an apple , oh yeah and like usual carmen was late for english service =p .
was laziness at its worst ... ..
that tops dan 's story about miss howard making fun of him for doing the i brought my guns to school *flexes arms lol .
about how animals thrive and stuff with food and without .
* so did questions , chatted for a bit ... .
lol me and karen have been postin ' pics up on martha msn group ( http : //groups .
it was just my family .
at first i sorta was panicking when i could n't find my snowboard ... .
me and her chatted for a bit about friday night still .
i do n't know who it is .
hahahaha afterwards they 'd lose anyways ... ..
interesting how there was an expo for volunteer organizations today .
i was surprised school actually has freedom , er freedom of speech .
but then again ... .
then c generals my comp acted up w/ graphics so i had to switch comps .
not much else happened ... ..
though it tends to be drab at times walking around the same stupid fob mall everytime , every once in a while something interesting may occur .
er broken on may the 7th 2004 while playing lunchtime b-ball .
they 're close enough .
and next year if i do well enough ... .
but gettin ' back to the main point ... .
mmmm ... .
well ... ...
i still do n't get how dejan can make his so good .
and makes your year one day longer .
huh ?
nothin ' much else left ... ...
whoo !
and jason said `` what the hell ?
and i still think civics is a waste of time .
oh yeah and of course a cup of coffee .
been a bit busy lately so hehe could n't blog as much as i usually do yesterday .
not much work as we are nearing end of the year .
it was pretty good stuff ... ...
wow leafs ca n't penalty kill .
comics ... .
meh fun fun i guess =p .
after that then i read scripture , phillipians 4:1-7 and then came the message .
it 's been agreed we meet friday for sure , then monday if needed .
and i 'm not surprised he got elected =p .
but noooo stupid english exam .
anyone ?
watched a really lame video and took more notes .
bye .
ugh it was lame .
i got a d on it *shudder* but somehow i managed a c for hysteria .
waste of precious piano playing time .
maybe it 's just the `` let 's see how much funm i can shove into one week ! ''
then waited for another 20 minutes for the bus .
he kinda deserves it i guess =p .
it was inconceivable ! ''
-bio : ow ...
blast deleted it by accident though = ( .
aaa maaafaaa !
all day long .
i was n't as hyper as usual .
i 'm not really complaining *cough gayness x7* and i 'm still smiling *grr ... ..
just before that though ... ..
* and then headed home ... .
so after that ... ..
originally i had my whole night planned out : ucc , piano practice , and then blog .
11 and 12 is like this ...
well after a ten minute walk ... ... ... ..
they make 8 year olds look mature enough to run a company .
wonder if i can join acf lol .
and yes like usual gabe was a beast at ball lol ...
another bad thing was carmen took 2 hours to get there .
-acts 2:17 it 's also pretty cool having the assurance to back up my thought of christ always with me with this verse .
i 'm unstoppable ... .
louis , desmond i think his name is and jacqueline , wendy 's cousin .
i guess it 's just because my day 's passed by so quick , and i 've done so much tonight already ( blogged , slept , msn , ps2 , dave 's over and typing up bio notes for underhill for project ) .
boy if he reads this blog he really gon na whoop my ass lol .
two games in a row .
mostly because well ... .
well now two since the other dude gave me another song .
what else to say i do n't know .
or too lazy so in the end it was the original people : me , dave , josh , gavin and jason .
so i did choice 3 .
i find downtown athlete 's world near very end which kinda sucked *blast .
they were talking about narcotics lol .
as we kept going on playing various games ... ... .
as i 'm typing ... ..
fell asleep after 2nd period ... ...
so after the eating ... ..
wait yes i did go to church .
i really agree with this definition .
everyone 's equal .
lol me calling university students kids ... ..
well keep scrolling down to the next part nothing to write about here ... .
well yeah with another bit of school done , the students and teachers finally get to enjoy a nice relaxing week of doing nothing .
10 year started ... .
our receiver consisted of washington from the pats and ...
330ish ?
and it seems like they mesmerize you to become a christian .
yes i just realized something .
she had some calculus stuff and i had my crap test for bio .
history class we watched this video called `` the wave . ''
i then see that the whole hallway is littered with bio projects for 4th period class .
this workshop was for the best though .
and of course for the rest of the hype group i wish the same also but i really would like to commend jason for intaking so much in 4 months so well .
later .
and of course the bubbling hostility between many of the students now and mr. baldwin .
so yeah not much in history .
b .
stupid single strap duffel bags seem to get heavier and heavier each day ... ... .
scales are easy though and the songs are just a joke .
*ponk*
whoo .
it did n't spill out haha .
plus some other things .
* oh well we are still all worshipping the same god , just that i like sitting near the front better .
saw some uwo people and then steve , sergei , mike , and evan .
so we spent our time learning about that ... .
new prescription for new glasses i still got ta get used to .
actually got there on time today though ... .
and i kinda missed guidance cuz of it =p .
but then again the president of the united states seems to not understand this `` complicated '' concept either .
and quickly ran over the songs before english service .
science class ... ... .
english class we started watching fgt movie .
throughout the movie he 'd honestly ask some of the dumbest questions ever .
i mean today in fellowship i wrote so much ... ..
she seems crazy sometimes too .
sorta .
got home ... ..
my arms are slowly going back into ship shape as i could actually manage to bench 115 easily today .
got piano theory still and stuff .
and english class was actually pretty funny for once hehe .
car ride to school ... ...
post-war canada really is lame ... .
breaking i still go on fridays , but at home ... ...
fit in around 6-7 games ... ..
well apparently that has now spurred josh into tryin ' to look into buddhism and see what makes them tick .
and it was really cool to see jason so attentive in class .
and ... ... .
and just reflected ... ..
after school it was badminton .
also it was nice to see that he has his bible by his bed .
also at the same time kinda retarted to think about how immature we were back in grade 8,7 and 6 .
we studied ecclesiastes chapter 4 today .
hmm ... ...
he had a comedic sense .
pretty much just could n't wait for quad meet ... ..
and off to english .
sure ?
kurtis pk ( http : //kurtispk .
some of them were hilarious too .
the first 4 were uhh ... ...
chatted w/ em for a bit , then went on to try to find the rest of the people .
so we all ran in our rooms for warmth .
yeah up until now i still think he really needs counselling .
i just seemed so tired for it .
so yeah i 'm gon na lose a few marks on that essay which sucks = ( .
oh boy mrs. mitsis is going to kill me when she finds out i 'm barely done half the papers .
well stage band went by quick , then walked to bus stop and talked to nick for a bit .
so yeah just made it into history on time .
least i got no day 2 h/w , except that stupid science crap .
so yeah this was when i prayed ... ..
* lates ! =p
3 marks for theory papers .
drumming seemed like a challenge ... .
then we started throwing in ideas on improving his handwriting .
and it worked lol .
then walked around a bit more , grabbed sometin to eat before the movie .
1/18/04 one day i do n't have homework ...
many of my friends have either stopped blogging or have not updated in a while .
po-kan would be good if he actually took the game seriously ... .
but in the end ...
i make it sound so exciting no =p .
prayers i do believe will be answered , and i guess this is just one of many other items i can pray about .
time to relax a bit .
was supposed to bring eggs but noooooooooooo .
kinda does make me wan na go .
then now i 'm sitting here ... ...
now i know my entries are long ... .
the new setup actually is n't bad .
one main thing is getting our room painted .
and chatted with him ...
then i got bored and decided to chat around w/ lindsay and them for a bit .
but yeah hilarious game ... .
really hope i make it into jazz ...
so stupid .
dave rutt then owned my song ...
not .
and bused home .
first message he was speaking about i unfortunately ca n't remember 100 % , but the thing that probably hit me the most was the miracle that happened in bc for him .
started geometry ... ..
sc all night lol .
ca n't remember much else .
my wallet could n't close .
then came song of response ... .
meh beats the more boring days of life though ... .
probably not ... .
well i doubt i 'll fail it .
i only got two more papers left =p .
josh who could n't make it , asked us what we got out of the movie .
i thought i did ok .
gavin : uhh ... ..
me mitch hammond and thompson used the hair dryer to dry our shoes *started by joe innovations , * then it overheated bout 5 times , and then the front of it smelled like ... ...
people understood why lol .
i say the `` s '' in braquets as thea was more of just helpin ' w/ the little kids ... .
and my day would go downhill a bit more ...
but hearing how retarted gavin and calvin were today at church ...
such a long time ago ... ..
i think mr. gilbert thought i was probably stoned or something lol .
today we had 70 minutes to finish up this vector assignment .
holy crap !
sta i heard is a good team but hey alex has got a pretty killer smash .
so 2 hour and a half later or so , the movie was over ... .
and was n't into the flow of things ... .
so played that for over an hour , with dinner , and fiddling with my new cell phone ... ...
then scrounged around for my snowboarding stuff .
yeah today @ ucc originally me , calvin and sergei were only people there , but more people came in the end .
and then walked outside , about to begin my trek to my bus stop when wham !
programming ... ...
amusin ' huh ?
and back to the same church i was at last day for kiwanis .
finlan kinda ditched her when he said he was gon na teach her .
1 theory ... .
lol i ca n't believe they would promote stuff like that back then ... .
and wump !
so like i said ... .
though it was long , it was fun though .
we played some sc , and then eventually we 'd be doing that for about two hours .
i have n't slept this much in ages .
for example ... ..
though his way of speech was pretty funny ... .
i kinda let everything compact itself in so i never really thought about guidance until now ... .
the best substitute for potato ... ... .
tc media .
done .
says so in matthew , mark , luke and john about how much he suffered .
we were early ...
ugh the wonderful world of biology ...
and today we are just preparing for our essay exam ... ...
got ta wake up early for worship tomorrow .
eventually i got caught though .
oh yeah and then me and okanski started making the faucet noise thing *the one where u hit ur cheek and make that water dropping noise* and pissed off the teacher .
after service headed downstairs for some really good cookies ... ..
programming ... ... .
math class ... ...
then dinner !
and now haircut ^_^ .
just a day of relaxin ' and seein ' what toronto really has to show about itself .
came mitch 's starting of the `` smurf . ''
and i realize chicken is a meat .
after school i went to belle air to pick up music , then home .
for me : virtually none =p .
but seeing my spending habits now ...
why must subway cost more than chinese dim sum it seems at times ?
geez if justin ever gets to read this entry ... ...
my qb is actually not anerexic anymore .
i hate exams .
oh yeah and adam 's intelligence at its prime : adam : alright people ... ..
she has the same cell phone as me though lol .
weird .
just kinda scared i 'll just blank out in exam tomorrow .
steph was jumpy through the whole thing lol and rebecca was hiding under her coat for a bit of it .
then july and august ... ...
hopefully .
and when it deflated when we died ... ..
my day started off in the morning at 7:30am .
it 's actually a book i 'm interested in .
not whale .
it was about david and the besor river ( spelling ? )
well now i 'm at the dinner .
whap whap whap ai ya !
* thought i 'd add that in ...
yes downtown is kinda weird .
oh yeah !
wump .
but yeah we started breaking that down , then we went into more detail about if grill was an exponent like the following : joe gavin : grill to the fourth plus grill to the fifth equals grill to the ninth josh : exponents do n't add unless they are multiplied gavin : that 's not true ... .
we incorporated some of the issues brought up at the meeting .
so yeah we took up about an hour .
you know the one that had trudeaumania and everything ?
well when i got home ... ...
i was heading into the music room for my trombone ... ..
i 'm actually kinda considering turning to sciences for my university career , cuz i do get decent marks in it , and it does kinda beat number crunching .
*shrug* i still got homework and stuff ... ... ...
anyways i 'm off now ... ...
lunch was probably my best time to do thinking today .
except for a better day =p .
at least thursday the avs are back in the game .
he made 1/10 serves .
just kiddin ' man i know i 'm worse lol .
1/12/04 on your mark ...
it looks cool ... ..
yeah so we got there around 8:45 or so ... ..
* so yeah right now life 's good with theory done , slowin ' down on piano since exam ai n't for another 7 months or so , and school 's almost over .
as they are back in toronto .
my mark is still above 90 so i do n't really care .
we had a 3v2 then .
then afterwards ... ..
pythagorean theorem at its dumbest .
we had a stock market simulating game .
fun .
lates .
but he tought us the aeiou way : ask questions enunciate ( emphasize some words ) in your own words other references use it i guess it 's a somewhat interesting way ...
i got up around 8am to get everything loaded into my van for may camp .
we played actually very well this morning though .
oh yeah ... .
but i thought the last band really beat out joe ogan 's band from last year .
hmm ... .
also melody went sorta insane , and me and thomas were on a hot streak w/ guessing words today .
least i have a dinner ^_^ .
mr. clark : the first sound yes ... .
tried getting out of homework by saying i sacrificed homework through lent =p .
so after walking up this massive hill to josh 's place ... .
and we did .
i do n't seem to understand why i seemed to like mixed doubles in grade 9 .
you know about how we are a good band , and how we are still a good band even if we do n't win anything .
but then again i hate liquid boards .
oh yeah then the chinese take-out remark i made ... .
i was surprised at the talent the director had in putting together this movie .
but holy crap when you wake up at a time before 11am ... ..
whew avoided chromatic scales test ^_^ .
blogging during tc lol ... .
so cool though lol ... ... .
it was nice to see some of the uwo kids back today though .
they were all there .
then it was time to go .
and then the seniors ( me , gavin , josh , brian and jason ) had lots to say .
and sleep .
i can do rollbacks better now ...
the point is i 'll remember it ... .
so after practice ... ..
then bused home ... .
honestly how the heck do you study for a english test ?
10 science .
marcello would be a pyro for the next 10 minutes then .
had a few good jokes .
i 'm actually working for once .
so yeah had to suffer that for only about 20 minutes instead of the standard 70 becuz of guidance ^_^ .
ate then slept .
frederick would also be there , plus a whole host of other people .
lol makes me laugh though when i see fob gangstas lmao .
right now it 's about ... .
about to cut my tylenol bottle .
headed back to the other room for some repetoire and then left class for science ...
*uh oh off planned time by 2 hours 20 minutes .
tip : when you have a sunburn..
back in my desk tomorrow ... ...
er not my average saturday hehe .
i 'll conduct = ) .
it was good .
i was going through very slowly through the door w/ my gargantuan bag when i hear a *click* and i 'm thinkin `` there 's no friggin way your lockin ' on my ya piece of crap . ''
sunday school class we finished up lessons about different names for christ ...
have n't done any breaking in over 3 weeks .
this morning was really retarted .
ps2+monty python+ good food=good .
brian would go back so i really thank him for taking us all home .
i mean i still remember last year on the train comin ' home from tc i was thinkin ' `` boy ...
joke course .
i do n't know either .
devos are supposed to help you understand passage .
yeah i was pretty tired today so i really wanted to get home ... ... .
actually it was n't too bad ... ..
wait ... ... ...
then we got into little groups like quartets and started playing random songs ... ..
oh yeah also got him a copy of sc=p .
3/24/04 image is nothing ...
wow ... ... .
so since class was cut short ... ..
oh yes ...
hmm ... ...
well yeah today was pretty short .
so that was the basic outline of english class .
but yeah still just the moment when he said it lol ... ..
meh i 'll figure that out later i thought .
i almost died at beginning but for some reason the enemy then ran and fought jason 's army .
wow he 's got lots of courage to use it .
orange liquid 5150 .
i myself have n't said anything as i have n't seen it , and i ca n't wait .
so until tomorrow 's entry ... ..
ate ... ... .
got home around ... ... .
so yeah after reading that ... .
that 's how crowded it was .
scales , dominant 7th chords , etc .
so did that for abit , then drummed , dinner , showered , and some other stuff in no particular order .
so altogether ... ... ... ..
but yeah this was a really fun time .
got one of those pancake breakfasts ... .
lazy sorta saturday , .
though i was n't there last sunday carmen did recap me on a few things .
more semi advertising .
as quoted from shaunvir : `` why are they so communist this year ? !
funny as hell .
civics .
only two more days until we drive four hours into the middle of nowhere , play for some hick school then head for the deerhurst^_^ .
finlan with his cockiness thought he was amazing at serving .
and also to avoid projectile vomiting if anyone else saw it .
plus i was actually kinda amazed that kids are independently standing in the middle of the halls for the anthem .
yeah senior band is n't much different from regular band .
argh now i want a red one ... ..
our play is amazin ' !
football , well that was the analogy that pastor mackness used .
* but yeah on our trip mr. rice was making fun of mr. douglas a lot and also talked about lots of stuff that happened to him @ yuk yuk 's when he worked there .
played the piano mostly ... .
well nothing special today .
i was dying there .
time to deposit my long earned money from starving @ lunch for 3 months plus various other occasions !
bastard .
not as lazy as usual .
not much excitement ... ..
think we did since hammond had double hat-trick and nikki just ca n't play net in hockey .
only their wallets probably ca n't close at all .
we both kinda got screwed over when they brought in the carriers .
called him back ... ...
actually it was n't that hard ... ..
boy i wish i wrote those down in my notes now .
so i ended up working out for a bit ... ..
tea is my source of caffeine .
i 'll consider going to jasper 's again .
*sigh* i wish that life would pass by slower ... ..
but anyways off to the beginning of my friday first .
i woke up around 1130ish .
no movie today though ... .
well after school , i had to go the the library w/ dan n ' mike for a studying thing for math .
so did that for a while , and then ate , and then played w/ jeff and some other dudes on sc again , and then h/w .
we immediately begin to prepare for english worship this morning .
so me , hammond , katie ... .
no nothing .
am i ready ?
and now off to skiing/snowboarding at hidden valley .
played the piano ... ...
wow .
i was gon na go study w/ mike n ' dan but was too tired ...
so yeah ...
we still screw up when david forgets where the shorcut to the bus stop is lol .
two quick victories of 11-2 and 11-1 .
but now it 's 10pm and i just got back from ucc .
i did .
hmm ...
i was already pretty tired out by five , where we had a break for a bit .
that is a point that kinda got me thinking ... ..
well now skip down to after school .
gorgon basically is when our church was pitch black , except for one room having light .
if she wants to make herself look like she does n't know how to drive a car ...
11 physics and dropped gr .
but getting home ... .
anyways when going to see shrek 2 tomorrow i also got ta pick up a new bag > _ got home ... .
last year was friggin ' amazing .
remember when i said i thought i forgot something ?
i 'm wondering do they really know what they 're doing ?
and also i can try to get my crickets back for breaking .
a ball of nails ?
it was pretty scary lol .
and a new building .
his banner kills mine .
and then said our thank-you 's and stuff and then headed downstairs .
all the usual teams made it in , and the usual teams got past round 1 , unlike last year which seemed to be the underdog 's heyday .
mine is a bit unique ... .
and over time it would turn into a black square .
so i went home ... .
at times i feel that god 's presence is n't always a happy feeling of just like `` oooh he 's here !
heh a creation by okanski .
so we then worked on turing , i for one got pretty bored and started surfing the net .
boring .
said the obvious .
krutika her name ?
oh yeah and just talkin ' to mike chan just now ... ..
then played the drums for around 30 minutes .
that or science .
*joe and josh just shake their heads with a 'gavin your an idiot ' expression* gavin : aww nuts ... .
reasons why i like head 2 head better than webstation : they have food , better comps , and a bigger selection of games .
yup ... .
more math studying .
2:45ish ?
1/6/04 4th day and running of having 7 hours of sleep or less well , now its come to that since my house has no coffee ... ...
nothing new =p .
gullable 's not in the dictionary ?
well the year sure kicked off for me really well ... ...
squash , raquetball , pool , hockey everything was there .
starting with a friggin phone call at 7am and lasting until 1130pm+ ...
the flag carrying , yelling , running around the church like my usual self at school ... ..
oh yeah out of random my english group partner christine comes and tells me the news that she did n't do jack shit for our project .
then headed into sunday school where we learned about jonah today .
so yeah gave mophead a ride back home and then i headed home ... ... ..
i seem to pray a lot more than before now though ever since my gr .
not .
history ... .
unlike some people who 's name i will not mention .
just the word clumpy lol .
meh ... .
weird though today .
march already ?
hehe lates .
and i 'm done my turing program = ) .
he does n't exist .
whoo 7 hours of sleep owns ! )
they then went on to play yuker ... .
well me and thompson left early , and we kinda saw jaime christian walking back to school , so chatted with him for a bit .
5/28/04 ahh ...
meh ...
however ... .
so he read in the car .
from 5-7 it was sc .
met some new people ...
5th maybe ?
i did n't even bother moving my arm to fluff my pillows .
that year would come by so quickly .
good to know at least i did n't spend my last day of the week in agony hermitting in front of my compy .
but ... ...
and it 's already come and gone by .
or something of that sort =p .
i got to school 'bout 805ish and pretty much headed straight to history .
will he be able to pull a 2nd or 3rd or 1st ?
i was pretty tired still from yesterday .
which was pretty funny lol .
today was the final day for mr. mccumber .
so that pretty much concludes my first day ...
like at the moment right now *well a few minutes back* i was thinking back on sunday after i read josh 's blog ( http : //counterbalance .
so yeah i saw john thompson too , and we went out for lunch ... ..
reminds me of the movie `` darkness falls '' since the gorgon can only roam in the dark .
jason and i did ushering for today .
your sons and daughters will prophesy , your young men will see visions , your old men will dream dreams . ''
now ... .
oh yeah ... ... ..
stopped half the shots comin at us .
only god can tell = ) .
anyways after playing some ddr , and watching some white kid suck at it lol i got a ride from jason to my house ... ..
then we all headed down for dinner .
the game was pretty one sided ... ..
hehe lates all ... .
like i started laughing my ass off when they said `` the chinks '' in one part of the play .
and changed my car from a impreza to a rx-7 .
but never icy .
scripture was from phillipians 3 3-9 .
and then ... ..
stupid thompson 's london chinese .
oh yeah and then came the starvation for 3 hours for mcd 's .
at least i can make my background sit in one spot now heehee .
well yeah after that it was back to civics .
i can see why now though britain lived ... .
woke up a round 7:30 .
basically our goal is to administer more growth in our fellowship spiritually and physically , and also just to foster a comfortable environment for all christians alike in our fellowship .
it served no purpose whatsoever .
math class : hmm ... ... .
10 that much .
uhh ... .
it was a pretty fun class today .
we studied/reviewed for our exam next wednesday .
i 'm very tired so i 'll do the good old short entry short form blog .
it seems as though communism has swept the kiwanis nation into a equality world ... ... .
but it had its downsides .
oh well ... .
we did n't know what we were doing and we were kinda screwed over .
mrs. wharton was conducting them .
but other than that ... ..
least jason sees a different face .
so this morning i woke up at usual time , got the usual things done like usual , and then headed out the door .
so messed up though .
it was pretty funny actually ... .
i never knew isaved up almost 400 bucks over last 3-4 months .
*trudge* now i 'm sitting in science .
science class was next ...
they had the london family and friends as one group out of the many .
and so after that victory ... ...
so yeah that will have to be summarized lol .
we got pizza ... .
lol two point games with 12 second shot clock in nba street were hilarious .
i went home and ate and then from like 3-6 i sat on the comp fiddling with photoshop .
i seem to like to take control .
that got us low on gas and lots of minerals .
meh whatever point is ... .
the sermon today was about `` pouring out your spirit . ''
and then ucc ( typical friday ) .
anyways today 's music class sucked ... .
100 minutes ?
so here 's the day story ...
math class anyways ... .
dawg ? ! ''
afterwards ... ..
shot around mostly , did n't play mostly because my shot 's still horrible , so i decided to work on my shot today .
i do n't exactly hate it , nor do i love it .
hehe i did n't really start practicing niki 's or kelsey 's until today ... ..
lol* and also we had a few exciting games of chess .
least it 's good to know i 've influenced another person to blog lol .
saw josh , steph and becca first , than brian and jason .
7:45am on a saturday ?
now i have my midterms on wednesday ... ..
english teacher , church people , then rachel brown told me too who sits behind me .
interesting '' said maisie ... .
well yeah ... .
though there were no first places , i do n't really mind .
but reminder that only 2 left= ( .
a mystery never meant to be solved *unless i 'm geeky enough to check every ip address .
but you still are joe passing .
i guess i feel ... ..
today was n't that bad ... ... ...
it 's so true that parents seem to think we need all the advice love can buy us , but when we give them advice , it 's worth just as much as the recycled toilet paper at a loblaws .
*ehem* talk to kurtis , listen to kurtis , talk back to kurtis ... .
then we killed the other one .
i actually liked it though .
pretty sweet eh ?
whoo !
afterwards though ... ..
i 'm gon na start walking . ''
circulatory system is very retarted , especially when you have ms. wiener as a teacher .
lcd monitors ?
or go back to toronto .
my max so far is around 200 mins a week .
nothing exciting ... ... .
then i had to do piano n stuff .
but yeah ...
now i 'm at home sitting here ... ...
eventually job would finally realize what he has done and repents his sin , and realizes that what he was doing was wrong .
hopefully you stay healthy enough to make next new years =p .
did n't get yelled at =p .
math : i did math .
oh yeah and now i 'm getting real tired and wan na sleep so i 'm gon na make the last part of my day short : -came home -ate -played some piano -played sc -showered -ate dinner and now i go .
while i was at his house though i finally saw the board tom kalazitis gave him that marcello was trying to sell now .
cya .
ali who was doing song of response w/ worship team went up and read the exact verse i was thinkin ' about .
and jenn convinced gerty to use friendster .
ok shut up if your laughing right now ...
also i may start to be buyin ' some wow worship cd 's .
tested jason 's theory of hmv not knowing about jin , but at least now they have heard of him , just they do n't know he has an album lol .
i had tofu and rice *lol* which i bet most people do n't think is too typical .
after that we went downstairs , chatted ... .
apparently it 's the new style in hk ... ..
church today ... ..
yup usual afternooon .
i finally decided that i did and then headed downstairs for my breakfast ...
it 's like street fighter ... ... ..
i really do n't like how i had to wake up at 6:30 am rather than my reguar 7:30 am .
whee !
damn you !
later .
17 '' lcd =p* if it was a gargantuan project .
we talked about the dieppe raid .
well yeah we got all that figured out and basically our schedule .
only a few more lines of programming ... .
this is the time where i sleep from 2pm-5pm .
we totally fooled calvin over msn lol .
well yeah now to rant on about the session ...
played a pick up game sorta thing ... ..
afternoon went sorta like this : bio class : note-taking + tirendess makes joe tired .
english ... ...
so i 'll summarize the rest of my day : -came home around 5 -slept till 7 -did stuff -shoveled driveway from 8-9:30 -ate -did last 10 % of driveway end ( stupid packing snow ) -practiced trombone -now i sleep .
ate ... .
anyways thompson had to leave a bit early cuz of hockey , while me and jason stayed for an extra 30 mins or so then left .
i mean workshop change , the message pastor kirk gave , josh 's prayers ... ..
also talked to some other people also , but ride is n't that long to althouse from central secondary school so in a matter of 10 minutes ( we ai n't exactly going across sometin like metro toronto ) we arrived at the college by around ... ...
thompson rocked him today lol .
i 'm definitely getting bf1942 if i get a new comp .
and then badminton for most of afternoon ... ..
did n't really finish it .
nominated boughton for student council ... .
except this time the strap was intact , and the joining thingy broke .
just pure silence and the sound of typing .
so we talked about how we sucked , and how we did decent i guess ... ..
he was wondering why he felt so energetic in the morning ... .
what changed ?
* gah ...
ate , talked about random crap ... .
doubt i 'll blog later unless somethin ' really cool comes up .
*flashin ' back to last night* well after blogging , i basically spent the rest of the day yesterday doing the mound of homework i had due for today and tomorrow .
so got to the place around 6:30 ... ..
we went from ghost stories to spinning a pencil top lol .
surprisingly everyone was early lol ... .
well tried and failed miserably .
and stress levels are at an all time low *whoo !
and yeah i also thought about the hype sleepover .
and the rest of us ate for a while .
so in the morning ... ... .
thank goodness i got lcd ... .
watched some boring movie about hitler .
great cheer lol .
we were at school .
me and nate would ditch mike and thompson for a bit ... .
so off i go to sleep now !
steve got a hat .
wans n't as good as last year 's but i 'm not surprised since each candidate had a $ 50 limit on campaigning .
* jokes jokes .
shepherd .
obviously semi was really fun .
so yeah ... ... .
we talked alot also just about how tc seemed to connect us back to our hype lessons too ( spiritual gifts one mainly ) and how it 's affected us .
well we finally got to church around 8:50 or so ... ... ..
i kinda feel bad that i never did it earlier ... ..
hilarious teacher .
i got 18.5/20 ...
hmm that 's basically all we did ... ..
ouch .
especially for an occasion like this .
rice .
so once again , if you wan na jump to a certain spot use the find feature and type in the date `` month/day/year . ''
oh yeah anton and jonny and calfun have no life and decided to pull the arnold schwarzenegger thing on me .
for a holiday kinda day wow .
easter weekend .
just knowing the fact that every serving attempt you had was wiped out by an onslaught of smashes , and you ca n't do anything about it since me and john only clear for smash reception ... ..
* and also blogging , dinner , and gon na start math review soon hehe .
mr. gilbert is n't the greatest teacher .
but for some reason she was n't there .
just so much to think about .
whoo !
3/28/04 the `` wonders '' of msn first off before anything else ... .
at this rate if i save 15 bucks a week , i make 60 bucks a month ( if i save 15 bucks a week , if i save 25 then 80 bucks a week ) .
thinkin ' about it bummer ... ..
i still kinda do n't get it .
hmm ... .
i have better things to talk about today than how history class went , or how math went etc .
so yeah basically did that from 8-11 , and then came home .
yes i 'm not a professional with modems maybe but i know who to call at least ... .
he was right there and we fell down and praised him !
that was pretty interesting to see .
and woosh !
that was it .
had a sub , then walked back to school bio ... ..
programming class ... ..
today was pretty fun .
and found gym without much of a problem .
then thompson made a bet w/ me and nate that he could hit maisie sitting at the other table .
imagine the guns are n't there hehe .
there 's still 12 days and i all the memories from 2k3 are already coming back into my mind .
grr my questions are sorta ruined now .
so i got there around 7:15ish and yeah she kinda made a remark about it .
so yeah like usual we played lots of pieces , and then today once again mr. clark merged his class with us .
if i 'm not wrong is she the first english testimonial person ?
we all got booted out around 12 though when mr. baldwin threw us all back in our rooms .
then some random pics of all of us .
there 's sometin new blogging at 230 ? !
well now i 'm at home doing finishing touches to careers .
and sleepin ' early tonight .
i would think a lot ... .
we started off with a `` mini '' bible study ... .
between the time switching looked over a few civics notes ... .
but yeah i do n't know why but all of a sudden i felt as though satan had a part in that dream , as it was somewhat anti-christian .
well jason would end up leaving around 2ish and i would leave around 2:30 .
lots of counting stuff today ... ..
lalalalala ... ... ... ... ..
i made $ 17.44 , and i had to cut money from so much crap just to make my budget work .
choo .
for some people it was a holiday ... ...
for some reason music goes by pretty slow now ... .
* like i said it was just another average day .
pretty cool stuff .
oh yeah and today 's gruesome part : breaking his jaw open .
* science like usual took notes and sorta fell asleep .
hmm ... .
went out to galleria for lunch .
i had never liked it thinking the music sucked .
is it a leap year ?
life would be way easier .
whoo !
*robert then realizes how stupid he is .
well anyways i called him up around 12 and basically from 12-3:30 we played nfl street .
but i really praise the lord for lettin ' him receive the prize .
yet again he is right in life *shakes fist .
then headed home .
i would not realize how heavy my bag was until now .
yes today was day two so i had music homeroom .
anyways point is me and gavin had to take over for ushering today .
eventually we managed to ... .
dreams .
i really hope that when the hypers now get spiritually mature enough to be councellors that we can make as big as an impact as the current counsellors have done .
well since nathan had midterms he did n't go out ... .
but then again i needed to see guidance today *which i did in a 50 minute interview* so yeah with my willpower i finally got up , got dressed n ' stuff ( morning routine ) and headed out the door ... ..
one of the most funniest classes ever .
but at least tomorrow ... .
but anyways before that comes i left from ucc around 5 and started walking home *ugh .
she had some jokes ... ...
it 's only 10:10 . ''
so i had to run down dundas trying to keep up with the 9a ... .
1/22/04 goung hei fat choi to all ... ...
shweet it 's postponed again !
very nauseating lol .
how could i ever have thought time passed by slowly ?
there is hope .
anyways got to school pretty quickly , and got out and headed for the school .
i woke up late and i 'll probably sleep early for once .
and me hermann and john got to take the taxi school provided haha .
heading downstairs after the service ... .
later .
anyways i 'm out now ... .
not .
and some lady that resembles someone off tv .
so yeah ... ..
too many jokes =p .
which is an improvement from well ... .
and it was so cold this morning .
one of the poorest countries in the world .
or something .
they could n't really reply to that .
but since the collision did happen , lots of us called our parents telling them we 'd run late .
on the way back pat was talking about mr. rice and how funny he was .
read romeo and juliet .
lol ada just told me she d/l all the pics off martha 's msn group .
i mite buy the game actually .
he still gon na be around ... .
bye .
jason left around 6:30 or so .
yeah i lost in the end , but for half the game calvin would barge in and switch around pieces in stuff .
so basically i woke up 20 minutes before we left , quickly grabbed some oatmeal to eat then left .
i needed to do math h/w n ' stuff ... ...
so boring , no offense monica if you 're reading this but no matter who was presenting ... .
well like usual sylviane and underhill just read it but justin actually sang .
well actually it 's the same thing since i 'm in a non-semestered system but it 's just that there was one change ... .
featuring back ... .
we get to do it !
5 mins can get pretty boring .
least she finishes school earlier than most of us ...
since i went to sjn now !
also ... ... ..
i 'm in the same room !
lol vince was there yet again ridiculing gavin 's guitar skills .
so yeah today ... ...
but it was wwii so it was all jokes =p easy stuff -civics : note on politics ... .
yeah today i 'm gon na basically be cooped up in my house anyways ... ..
dreaming of a band with gerty and joy lol .
so after food came , quickly my family dived into the food ... ..
so me and jason ate quickly , and the played some 007 .
but other than that ... .
unfortunately thompson hates it already cuz he got the same thing i got *chicken salad wrap which i like* and nate just sat there doing his math h/w , then ate his lunchables lol .
no more mr. mccumber i just remembered hahaha .
right now i 'm kinda half dead ... ..
i thought i saw a person from lcac .
and would be our only time rehearsing for our kiwanis class later on in the morning lol .
class ... .
now at least i know the basics of programming .
sam , who was in my group for some of the games .
yeah i 'm pretty much done for tonite ... ..
and then ... ... ..
yeah i realized something was different lol .
wow it 's freezing or it 's soaking wet .
so after the baptism headed back downstairs for some chattin ' , and pictures w/ steph .
well if i find a pair in toronto maybe i 'll get one .
notice the sarcasm .
both seem pretty obsessive w/ drama though haha .
*sigh* so many people that i first met in english service when i first started coming .
it 's weird ... ..
so i sat there , taught myself 3 new guitar chords *no way !
there 's a reason why no one buys his jersey anymore .
at central ... .
i think that my prayers really did come through for me .
could only be one reason .
no pushing into snow , no snowballs .
needed it though since at 2-6 i 'll be playing baddy , which was so much fun today .
personally i really wan na be able to grab my toes when im doing airchair .
but the editorial cartoons part was great .
pretty good movie seeing the fact i only saw about 70 minutes of it so far ... .
gavin was pretty humiliated afterwards .
later .
later .
and 57 % on bellringer .
to my house .
2/17/04 only 1 more day until huntsville !
more music !
our rehearsal started off with no clarinets until about 5 minutes in .
then i left 10 minutes later .
for those praying people out there .
pelting paper balls at someone while they were trying to find a yellow circle .
only like 10 people are going to semi .
he was there earlier than us .
yeah on with my day .
anywho for the rest of my day ...
ugh stupid 101.3 ... ...
very lame .
anyways , yeah after that both our hands were purple ... .
famed rec orientation again !
er more of speeches to make you vote for him/her .
and what else ... .
then headed out the door for my kiwanis event .
thank goodness lol .
after seein that though ... ... .
3/13/04 first day of freedom !
not everything 's a win win situation .
it was cool though ... ... .
`` want me to give the list in order ?
beats food and just alcoholic drinks at new years .
i was kinda peeved but we still got to our aim location : the eaton centre .
since i mean me and john we kinda suck but surprisingly we won all 6 lol .
it was time for civics .
foooood ...
meh , i do n't really mind i just wan na find out how my eyes are doing now .
`` well the proposed idea of a 30 minute jam session by myself turned into a 30 second one ... ...
and then mr. curphey was as usual lecturing us about random stuff and we watched a real lame video on tornadoes .
he 's an alright kid though i guess ... ..
thing with me : if i find a book i like ... ..
yeah boring huh ?
the torture was the part where i really was surprised of how much they pictured jesus going through .
so finally we started a bible study after everything was settled down .
so i 'm stuck with pretty bland music for trombone .
rumour has it that over 500 people have also seen the risen jesus .
a whole breakfast plus a coffee .
i would be totally burned out .
it 's really benefiting though in the end i guess ... .
sat around ... ... .
after the balling , josh and rebecky finally arrived , and it was dinner , so more eating ^_^ .
but yeah the main message in the end of this to me ...
it 's great =p .
ugh this is the 2nd time ...
probably biggest pm pimp ever lol .
and just got to know some of the other people in the english service that normally attend on sunday mornings .
7am !
message today was about the verses in chapter 4 ( vesres 8-9 ) that talk about basically thinking of positive things ... .
4/2/04 hmm ... ..
or boring ... ... ..
after english ... ..
before christ died , the apostles were even kinda shaky about the faith , and even fled when jesus was arrested .
so yeah after realizing that today during church ... .
wonder how they 'll take this whole thing .
argh how i wish the school year would end quicker .
we were a tad late ... .
got ta shower and sleep hehe .
yes ... .
yum^_^ ...
sho good .
so heaaded up to the mezzaine to watch the games ... ...
wan na go there and give it a try .
programming ...
he ran his ass off while i sat ... ..
the sun 's up now when i rise .
i actually spent a lot at lunch these few months , going to jasper 's n ' stuff .
leafs lost , detroit lost *surprisingly* and colorado lost band this morning : i 'm actually starting to sound somewhat decent .
=p .
it was crazy !
and trying to crunch the many syntax errors within my program down .
lol .
lina needs to copy my blog for hers plus i 'm done for the day hehe .
the meeting went by fairly quickly , and i liked how the counselors really listened to me and josh .
i actually managed to play post fairly well , and also made a few decent blocks .
robert : huh ?
i beat him in one song !
so people got a few laughs out from that ... .
but like usual i got ta cover my day before i reach the climax .
yeah i thought the sens would win !
oh yes and i have yet to discover another talent of mine .
so meh whatever thought might as well give him a bit of a chance .
art if you like it can be sketched for appreciation .
nor was it very long .
but still beats any toprock i 've seen in breaking .
so went upstairs when gavin and calvin also came .
lakers rivalry between lina and jason building up already haha .
so there i was ... .
and 'sides more time to finish my novel .
least i still won something i guess ... .
well i 'm out ...
but everyone still got silvers !
-woke up -did daily wake-up routine -went to eat lunch w/ wendy 's family at dragon court -came home -went to rogers w/ pat to rent stuff -came back and found out paul and family had arrived -ate dinner -played ps2 n stuff -sleep time .
* but it all ended off with a pretty good friday .
well it was pretty funny to watch .
but they caught up .
well after school ... .
i think i 'll get cut though lol i 'm actually terrible now .
well after that got my daily dose of tea to wake me up and down to the comp i go to check msn and email .
j/k i 'm not that stupid .
both ways , while the leafs were struggling , i was sitting on the couch laughing at their crappy game .
84 in programming .
and was so annoying throughout performance when my parents for some reason called me 10 times .
or have lots of time .
girls did n't do too bad either .
yes that 's without the `` s '' as will pointed out .
this is the first and probably the only time i 'd see someone fail to set a clock properly .
i do wonder more about how god 's word is being spread as i 'm typing right now ... ...
also hammond had to put away the eggs so they would n't go bad .
all of a sudden i wake up at 6am the next morning ?
for a monday , this one 's been somewhat mellowed out .
that 's basically it .
it 's english not history class !
stuffed teddy .
heh josh got the video and i got the pics .
* nope i 'm still here ...
* then he kinda started wwii .
yeah after that basically i left taking jason w/ me to my house ... .
and i think he was bulding up momentum to his pms state ... ..
do n't we outnumber them already =p .
well josh and sauron had taken down some comp , but then me sauron and jason made a huge landing on another comp .
oh yah also ... ... ..
oh wait it 's been invented *blast !
grr .
but that was n't the situation at 7am .
go ... .
i really did n't wan na go to school .
slacking off to its maximum .
but chinese tv dinners !
today was a pretty quick passing day actually ... ..
i started wondering if that has happened yet .
i kinda came up with a metaphor with the fact of how a small foot can fit in a big shoe , but not the other way around .
but yeah lost that , but lucky i had my combo lock with me .
think his name was greg dun really remember .
then came 4pm .
studying ... ... ... ..
well right when we moved in so 13 years .
so i quickly went in , dropped off the stuff and then headed to first period class : music .
meh guess not , since they seem to still be convinced after almost a year that saddam has wmd 's even though they have n't been able to find any trace of one .
and yeah it was pretty lame lol .
governments ...
got my essay on jfk back .
got ta head to bed soon hehe .
still has n't lost its fun .
after the lesson *and brulees* , calvin , jason , and gavin came to my place ...
so yeah everyone was hoping they 'd battle us first lol .
went to jasper 's cafe and did some bio h/w .
the irony/crappiness of that .
then after that went on msn for a bit ... .
so like everyone else i lost an hour of sleep *grrr* and woke up and then left for church .
mmm coffee ...
weirded out .
and the announcements came on .
me and dave spent half the time staring at hammond 's palm pilot thing while he was playing jawbreaker or sometin *kinda like collapse* and took some notes down about governments .
apparently the aftermath of the `` snowstorm '' began to show .
well i 'd be there till 7:30 ... .
it 's as though god had set the whole thing up .
after music headed up to science class .
30 minutes or so .
apparently these 3 days in london have all been around -25 with windchill .
anyways that 's all we did for class , and then handed 'em in .
well i managed , and i decided with this spare time i 'd add some cell numbers into my phone .
it was kinda weird last night .
total human nature i know ... .
but yeah basically it went sometin like : wilson : anyone in here willing to sell their semi ticket ?
basically each day was military training , and then one day ... ..
it also shows how god is understanding .
we went to jasper 's cafe today ... ... .
and this is where my day ends .
did n't really see anyone i knew ... .
easter weekend 's over *sigh* burgh ... ... ..
it was actually a very touching story ... ..
talked to some people , see who we were gon na battle .
-john 3:16 ... ..
couch ... ... ... ... ..
well today since it was last day i decided i 'd treat myself *wow i 'm very generous to myself no =p* to a nice luxurious lunch @ jasper 's .
i think =s .
cya .
dangit i wanted to go ... .
and then to church .
i can see why naps are so productive in their own way .
well , now 's about the time where i sleep , make a few thoughts about whether i really will be commited enough to blog everyday , and think of ways to make life interesting .
we could easily own wwf in viewers lol .
wee !
and after that boring class comes the icing topping for boredom ... ..
joe : gerty ! ?
both those games i am interested in .
well we did n't really do much else ... ...
but i do remainder of the workshop i participated in .
well piano lessons actually start at 1230 but i only live like 2 mins away ... .
so therefore ... .
coincedentially we were also doing phillipians 3. lol .
superstation is now one of the best channels on tv i have just realized .
the story is more complicated but i 'm sorta zooming by because it 's over 1am and also i still got ta cover another half of the day lol ... .
the previews were all about cartoons and comedies since the movie 's pg .
holy crap was it boring !
as it is a noutreach night also for non-christians .
she tells us to shut up ... .
oh yeah i remember now !
so yeah i 'm headed to bed now ... ...
ergh ... ... ..
lates .
literacy test results ! ?
gon na fail bio test like maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad ...
i feel so old calling people my age kids lol .
making a gimp run after me hahaha .
* i do n't exactly hate him but he 's a bit of a jackass .
but really last few months ... .
actually normally i pray in like a letter format ...
it was a pretty cool presentation though ... .
i want sleep lol .
as i had to wake up early to do worship at church this week .
though this may not be exciting or nerve-racking for some ... .
this one might not be that exciting ... .
and of course i ca n't forget the trailer for phrinj movie night .
get in the times you outdated shmucks !
woke up , went to school , history .
not that i do n't like em ... .
sens vs. leafs ... .
though it seemed somewhat like you guys were winging it sometimes ...
we have a cheesy mini-game show that totally failed at the end lol .
and we did = ) .
look out tc !
ok i lost in it thats why !
food .
bused home , chatted w/ dominik and ryan .
music class consisted of still choosing our pieces ... ..
really happy w/ it =p .
but yeah it was really speaking about how missionaries do so much in this world ... ...
i mean just the fact it mocks you by saying you 're only halfway through the week already peeves me off enough .
so yeah last 4 days ... ..
yeah chatted with gerty and jenn for 'bout half the time and then jason , gavin and them .
*1 hour later* just passed cambridge , and i 'm still listening to music .
yay i 'm not blind no more !
then had to board the bus for the inn and then home .
well maybe not .
then headed out for home ... ..
they were bio notes lol .
woulda got 2nd= @ !
i decided to wear a scarf as a turban and walk around pretending i was taliban .
lates .
then game 7 ... ... .
= ) yeeeheeeheeheehee !
hah !
since he 's in toronto .
jason was gon na pre-order sc ghost ( i was too but forgot ) but in the end we did n't because this family in front of us took friggin forever to buy one game .
what luck .
argh !
typing up english presentation ... ...
ugh stupid band .
thompson got the two forms also .
but yeah my night kinda took a turn *instead of sleepin ' at 11 i slept at 1* when i helped someone do their history ...
great time record set ^_^ .
i mean the presentations are really good , just that even @ school i always fall asleep after lunch .
oh yeah and english test : 90 % beehatch !
exclusive every four years !
deserters ! ! ! !
programming : wo n't elaborate much .
nate : just trying to match your wrist skin colour w/ your neck 's .
we played one of those games where you like clap your hands , snap your fingers and stuff and have to say someone 's name , except the names switch around depending what chair you 're in .
i could barely move .
argh and to make things worse i had to endure sawdust , smell of spray paint and various other things while making my bio project tonight with underhill at my place .
and mrs. wharton commended stage band x in senior band .
apparently me , lina and jason were n't the only people who stayed up lol .
yup at piano lessons now .
and it 's so hard to believe that it was only the first week back in school from the christmas holidays .
yup ...
went downstairs and was met by a bowl of `` joak '' for breakfast .
what am i gon na do ? !
and well so yeah ... .
oh yes the word `` l33t , '' bit overused by megatokyo ... ... .
i would do grade 8 exam in january ... ... .
argh ... ...
it really shot a good point , which i 'll explain later .
also made fun of thompson and his crummy piano playing .
then for group pics .
well after music class it was time for science ... ..
whoops =p .
i really need to work on breaking more .
gah forgot what it was .
may wan na spend more time on piano though ehhehe .
had to go home and help chop down mr. tree in my backyard ... .
then we all left for home .
with me , lilian , lucy , rachel , and kelly *i think that 's her name* doing the skit where ruth gets taken back to whistle stop w/ big george , julian and idgie * i was julian =p .
and jazz band .
then called adrian over for a bit ... ...
this sunday she will be embraced by christ through the act of baptism .
to think i have to be that image next year in senior band ... .
and some other stuff ... .
ate a late lunch , then played some sc w/ jason .
stupid 9er .
and now here i am sitting at home .
cautiously ... .
mr. clark passed around this piece of paper for us to put down our snowboarding/skiing skills .
you know your class is sad when the teacher says you 're too quiet .
so after everyone got here *age had to leave but meh* we started our hype meeting at my place .
and turing has actually helped me a bit with programming actual things now .
-home and doing the church slide show .
lol oh yeah the 6 man pyramid lol .
since she is the first hype kid to be baptized .
played some games w/ alex and then started my final project sorta .
the speaker , who 's name was charlie , spoke about well ... ..
and we began glueing together our masterpiece .
talks about old days in montessori ... .
so yeah we read that , took some notes , and etc .
k yeah i was pretty cornered by then ... ...
apparently it started at 10pm ... ..
after school watched some tv , homework , then caught the last episode of friends .
finally arriving home ... ..
so far ... .
main floor .
well just our luck .
we did bible study , and we were still revolving around the community lesson from yesterday at first .
which left me with none other than ... ..
sunk one from outside perimeter and then another one around the foul line .
these few weeks have been tough .
`` mr mckelvey ? ''
we talkin ' like 50 page essay or something .
mmm ... ... .
today was n't the biggest meeting ... .
also the demonic figures chasing judas after he turned in jesus for the money , that was scary too .
starved like maaaaaaaaaaaaaad ... ...
as for the rest of fellowship tonight ... ...
ca n't be much worse .
craaaazy stuff , but cool .
i had to call dad , and send myself home , save it as a powerpoint *shudder* and then drive back to church , which killed an hour .
i hope it is n't too late lol .
point is someone got married to someone .
usually we play through 10 bars and work on those .
crap it 's raining outside .
for godzilla , i actually have a really easy part .
oh yeah then thompson made a very lame attempt to use nathan 's `` got a dog '' line on mr. gilbert .
see my day 2 's really suck .
so today was spent much attending seminars ( mine were mostly about the wars and conflict issues around the world ) , eating pizza @ pizza hut and coming home .
but it woulda been difficult both ways ... ..
5/17/04 lazy day ...
probably one of them could school me and john .
just to bring my average up ... ... ... ... ..
anyways i got ta sleep now .
but yah n e who ... ..
the dance mix makes it better because i 'm into dance more than soft rock =p .
crappy theory .
*1 hour and 30 minutes later* listened to other groups play ... ..
and then we just chatted around for a bit .
`` he kinda just thought about it then lol .
later .
we get notified about exams ... ..
but after that , headed down to the main building for breakfast , and then a bible study afterwards .
that brought lots of whoa 's and screams .
cam : i 'll sell you mine for $ 200 ...
as he somehow cluelessly thought does .
yeah playoffs took a much different turn from last year .
cuz next team i know we coulda won .
though it 's true britain whooped germany 's ass .
also i spent half the time filling out my central form , and talking to nick about music .
shoulda bought a new p4 comp and sc4 .
some person was locked up in a locker trying to claw its way through at me .
thinks she 's lauren .
by the time i got home i decided to just hide in bed because it was actually warm ... .
did a wee bit of breaking at home .
anyways though ... .
gay gay gay gay gay !
nothing .
wow ... ... .
he coulda at least said it to thompson 's face .
unstoppable !
while at home though i drummed for a bit , watched tv , surfed internet ... .
we did what no other team has managed to do yet = ) .
mrs. wharton was unfortunately sick *mood change there hehe* so we sadly had mr. clark teaching us .
yeah but i really need to catch up on devos .
well i 'm not used to 5-page long music in band yet ... ...
actually one thing that kinda got me thinkin ' on the train today was my devo .
that was when people began to direct me around places ... ..
so like my huntsville blog *this is probably gon na be goin in w/ my look back blog also* i have a few final things to say ... .
sc ... .
i mean i like the subject ... .
well that was basically it ... .
plus this was a first time thing .
anyways when i got home ... ... ...
mmmmmmmm good steak ^_^ .
i think they were rebecca 's pics .
stacking , map hacking , not letting anyone do anything without my consent or jason 's ... ..
pizza ) .
how come i never knew about it ? !
but yeah hope that dude keeps on comin .
yeah today was kinda boring , sc was fun *we creamed gavin in a 3vs.1 triple j beatdown .
gavin dave and josh were still with me .
day 3 of may camp er more like 2.5 ... .
right now where i stand it 's impossible for me to fail any class =p .
took a few photos ... .
and so far my day is going well .
science ... .
it even has 64mb integrated video card .
we went to mcd 's since it was big mac day .
i mean i know some people will , but i did n't for my own reasons , and i do think it 's perfectly fine if you do and no you wo n't die if you did .
now it 's around 3pm or so .
someone said that according to jason .
yeah that 's where i found out stefan came earlier just before i came .
english exam but i 'm not worried .
well anyways ... ... .
last year it was too i think .
not exactly predestination either .
where i 'll be in home *not so sweet but still alright* home ... .
hopefully i get another one =p or a better quality bag lol .
oh yeah zavitz got his red adidas track suit .
whoo ... ..
it really shows how power is n't necessary to win a battle , and it 's mostly about style .
and then headed out to ucc after a dinner of a omlette that sorta resembled a western omlette no breakin ' tonite ... .
who cares about my trombone piece ... ..
and i was still pretty peeved in the car .
and she even thought was total b/s how some girl won playing a piece that was out of the rules .
idea and go for the asian 3 pack and some social science courses .
well doom was 2d lol .
when you look @ someone one thing you judge them by is their clothes .
seems to be a favourite place for uwo students to go to lol ... .
jasper 's has iced cappuchinos !
really boring like usual .
looked at it for 'bout 10 secs then left lol .
also we spoke about how christians are encouraged to marry other christians , as people with more things in common probably get along better right =p .
and then headed downstairs to get ready for 2nd game .
so we ate our breakfast , also started packing .
since i was kinda tired ... .
as no one else came back here ... .
not much else i do n't think ... .
bunununununuunuuuunundundunudnununuunuh !
i 'd actually wan na go see that movie again .
but after that wild weekend ... ..
the person that made the stupid wake up call @ 550 for us ?
they 're real cool kids though .
sad calvin just sad lol .
bah another wednesday .
gavin , josh , david and jason : next time i 'll actually know where i 'm going in toronto ... .
anywho , went to pizza hut with hammond , where eventually we met up with mophead there .
if you have one big and one small oxen , life is a bit more difficult to plow the field ( the plowed part being life 's achievements ) .
fine i 'll give him some credit .
unfortunately mom was n't awake yet so i did n't really have a breakfast .
he had good mandarin though .
no way !
woke up at around 830 or so ... ..
though i lost both times it was pretty fun playing it .
and probably produces more radiation than a nuclear power plant .
so we ate lunch ... ...
* after that class ... ..
today 's lesson : corporate vs. consumer churches .
kendrick took his car and tried to run me over too lol .
and home ... ... .
kendrick and thomas came for a bit also ... .
well yup this will be going down in my personal history until ... ..
so headed downstairs after doin ' morning routine , ate , packed my bags and then left for school ...
so i ended up working in the library ... .
i mean it really gave me a big punch in the face .
to my first seminar : war and empire ...
had to pickup jason too ... .
trigonometry is a joke =p .
get it right lunch is at 11am at school !
ooook so she 's not a stalker *whew* lol .
stefan and sergei and mike and evan came around 7ish or so ... ... ..
now i head to music class .
it was official ... ..
i guess i 've been livin ' by the whole idea of `` private use is ok '' sorta thing .
well i sat around home for a bit ... .
wth ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ?
it was as though the holy spirit was actually in me ... ..
i mean it 's been written in over 20,000,000 books in this world , and translated into more than 200 languages ... ..
possible ?
not a whoo !
* so yeah here goes ... ... .
not much else happened .
yeah that was pretty much my day i 'm zippin ' by it really ... .
it 's over now anyways .
and in math it was like usual .
right at the beginning we ruled out the hippie since well ... ...
82 now hahahahahahahaha !
it was pretty amusing when mr. roxburgh *our sub teacher for curphey* was all set to let the first car rip ... ..
i finally presented .
also i got to find a book i 'm actually interested in =p .
you know , with the water , and sun , and grass and stuff .
yeah you talk a little bit .
while we were waiting for my dad to finish cleaning up jason was trying to read his gmr magazine ... .
ali 's really was touching ... ...
of constant tacking of compy keys and *woam woam* of monitors ... ..
well at the end i was n't the poorest at least .
as one big point always is that you are murdering a child ... .
3/24/04 well ... .
so today had it 's ups and downs .
hmm ... ..
and then the bus ride home .
we ran through music , and stuff ... .
gah why could n't our student coaches be here they actually play badminton .
so after waking up this morning ... ... .
played diplomacy mostly tonight .
but yeah it was nice to see basically what people thought ... .
seems like around this time of year like any other year , this time is either tests or reviews for a test or exam or review for an exam .
finally !
3/10/04 moment in joe 's life : his debut ... ..
well i ended up getting a smaller one because subaru impreza 's do n't look good with fob spoilers .
by now in theory we do n't really learn anything .
sarah , josh and gavin talked for an endless time before starting their prayers , and becca , steph and calvin 's group i dunno .
oh yeah the scavenger hunt !
apparently patrick 's dad was trying to find out where to drop off pat tonight at the hilton .
then there was also like usual our hockey talk at lunch .
actually he was pretty funny today ...
well so i stayed on msn a bit .
in the end though i moved to sit beside rebecca , and mitch moved to sit beside jessie ... ... ..
and sang okanski happy birthday lmao .
well this happy day started off with my usual morning awakening to another sunny day .
it 's just green ... ...
after the food fest though , we headed downstairs and watched the chinese movie ... ..
tomorrow marks the first day of in class exams week .
usa needs to learn how to spend their budget and also stay out of another country 's issues .
since i had no homework on sunday i have some tonight ... ... ..
music class ... .
ate , morning routine , and then headed out the door ... ..
and i think i did a good job on my part ... .
tommy : no .
hoo .
thanks a lot to both of you guys ... ..
just seeing such generosity within our congregation really brings up my dream as a possibility .
hail , rain , lightning , etc .
pretty ez if u ask me .
a bright green shirt ? !
but eventually we got in a huge convo/debate about how chinese has no alphabet , and nate did n't seem to get it .
i 'm confident we 'll get a good mark though ... ..
so obviously you want to go too .
but jason 's house is actually pretty far from central .
and of course rice ... .
i hope you people find this verse as meaningful as i did : `` 17 do not gloat when your enemy falls ; when he stumbles , do not let your heart rejoice , 18 or the lord will see and disapprove and turn his wrath away from him . ''
good to see us gettin ' to know one another already haha .
stage band x ... .
other than some talking , we actually ran through the music really smooth .
it 's like how i 'm a gentile christian ... ..
pastor mackness used sports a lot in his analogies today ... ..
well after watching some tv ... .
so came back home ... .
steph said her testimonial .
cramming for history tomorrow ... .
left eye is still the same basically =p .
i told you guys the blog would be awesome !
wow ... .
we do n't sound half bad .
and ... ...
so took some notes down about that ...
lates=p .
as mentioned before plus tried greek cuisine for the first time in my life today ...
pizza ^_^ .
today i just decided to work on crickets ( really needed em back ) and turbles ( need those too ) .
as i will do throughout this blog ...
that 's a +6 improvement lol .
than the infamous dave rutt =p .
but just from last night after i stopped blogging until even now ... .
lol all jokes though .
ugh had to write the fastest ever of my life .
after some marking of theory ...
maybe they 'll have the $ $ $ to afford a weather predicting machine ... .
we were both on msn , and we were talking to calvin , and somehow convinced him we were at two different houses .
and then sleep and get ready for the big trip home tomorrow=p .
speaking of which i forgot when her b-day is ... ..
went in , bought some stuff , and then ... ... .
did some stuff ... ...
before that though we all stopped at fast eddie 's for some burgers and fries .
ken : ... ..
bet you never thought of it that way haha .
plus it 's so quiet on the bus ... .
now that class was over , pastor mackness went upstairs to catch the last bit of pastor long 's cantonese service sermon *which was in english translated by a translator into cantonese* and the rest of us just chatted for a bit .
hmm ... ...
do n't know about the others about walking in circles in t-dot=p .
doing all that and still succeeding in theory and school ?
meh .
apparently jason was haha .
set tomorrow for studying @ jason 's house ... ..
two truths and one lie , which i failed to be able to play lol .
well dat was basically the end of my day ... ... .
slept intill 730 ... ..
with the added problems like half of the people ca n't count ... .
and this is one of them .
lucky i packed everything last night ... ..
next year though i 'm really hoping more people will show up ... ..
wow amazing !
so 75 minutes of pure crap .
but i fixed it !
not very smart as up until now my jaw is still numb from chewing the huge piece that was in my mouth .
though i had an english exam but that would be forgotten within minutes after i was done ... ..
even i thought it was though ...
last period bell rang .
sad part is he says next car he 's thinkin ' about that suv .
i mean ... ..
wonder how i 'm gon na get these developed lol .
and then 5 minutes later she starts blabbering .
well today music class sorta started with a jumpstart when mitch fell off his chair and made the xylophone thing fall too lol .
a little on the personal note and it was about someone and i dunno if they 'd want me to mention it .
*shrug* my marks going up at least =p .
piano lessons ... ...
started off with gettin ' to know one another , and then poof we were on our way =p .
lucky i 'm basically the only veteran mixed doubles player lol so i ca n't get cut =p .
it 's gone up two percent !
but we still went on ... .
blasted leafs .
and my night went somethin ' like this -sc -theory -sc again when i got home -studyin ' for theory anyways i 'm out for the night ...
well a spiritual version of sex ed .
got 95 % on ecology test ...
well they managed to get two planes up to fight ... ... .
so packed i forgot lunch and my afternoon nap i was planning ...
so i was kinda close .
i actually learned a lot from him .
but he really needs to look over his notes .
well before that ...
it ended off with a `` calm '' prayer .
mmmmmmmmmmmm subs .
but yeah that 's one basic layout for praying .
must choose ... ... .
ahh yes that awesome feeling of `` yup i 'll just sit back here and watch the day go back . ''
to think one day all of it will be gone , and i 'll be in heaven , way from war , pain , suffering , sadness ... ..
they actually sound pretty good ... .
that was brutal .
you like ?
jasper 's today and did some quick studying for my bio test ...
i played some ball in bare feet *which is n't the coolest thing* and also we had some games of some tag game and just chilled also and stuff .
my project 's quality is degrading rapidly .
they were good .
see ... ... ..
`` deem ah teefy ! ''
wow ... ...
i was already late to pick up jason but meh not like anyone 's gon na be there earlier than us ... ..
we didnt ' really do much ... .

no one 's there on thursdays for some reason .
well after playing for bout 30 mins it was time for 4th period .
who cares ? !
someone hid arthur 's shoes , stole some of lazarus ' food *whoops lol* and diana is apparently an amazin pianist .
and then after that i drummed for a bit .
i 'll stick w/ my crappy graffiti display pic for now=p .
50 pounds of meat has never been better !
hmm i think mainly because i guess i chill w/ different people ?
wow you know you 're bored when huh ?
i am still friggin scared @ the part i 'm in at the game right now , so i wo n't play it till later on tonight .
ca n't complain .
innovative no =p .
sho good .
then okanski : `` man ... ... .
that summed up most of my music class .
i decided to play db and line at offence lol .
wah !
another part of the film that i found really well made was the emphasis on how pilate *the judge that condemned him* did n't want to at all , and tried all he did to save jesus ' life .
etc .
wow ... ... ...
plus 5 hours of badminton ... .
so yeah slept for another hour .
yep ... ..
lates .
huntsville !
now ... ... ..
so sometimes being out of the ordinary can really whoop ass .
hmmm ... ... .
ha ?
well least my bio presentation went well .
yeah 3 of us in that room afterwards ... .
i 'm just finding it kinda interesting how almost 60 % of the people now have x 's in front of their msn name .
they had to go places .
well after waking up from a phone call from gavin , i decided to haul my butt outta bed , did all da morning stuff , then headed downstairs for a lunch of porkchop *mmmmm ... ... .
we had an ok game .
except for the fact that lina started comin ' to church now ... .
well some but not as much .
surfed net , struggled to figure out turing like my usual self .
uh oh lol .
well i 'm out for the night ... .
then again ...
there were only 3 flutes compared to the usual 40 billion , and 2 trumpets lol .
i got ta be headin ' to bed .
he did his on kinecieologists or w/e the heck the spelling is .
i was really surprised at the turnout of people today .
yeah we talked about movies like darkness falls , butterfly effect , chuckie , etc .
finally !
