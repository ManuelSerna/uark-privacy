me and will lost at newlywed game..
and there is no one there to take care of him either !
finallllly someone comes down and opens the door for me- upstairs new person i guess ?
we have a n64 at work here , but mostly we just play mario kart .
so we stayed for a bit , it was pretty fun .
another week passes us by ...
: ( oh well !
what happened to the highlighter ? ?
haha just kidding .
we are so useless when it comes to bugs- its ridiculous !
and i understand that , but as a part time job that doesnt pay incredible ?
we 'll see though..
i think we just slept in ...
i have a cs lab tonight too .
i dont think i 've ever been to a wedding , well a real real wedding .
i saw one was like at a sopi tahoe retreat in 99- and the wish i made came true .
too much killing ...
im always studying !
im going to study study now ...
thursday i had 141 homework due , and friday no class !
wish me luck on not having a nervous breakdown !
for some reason i have problems with big knives .
this is will and my 's 6th one together ?
which is such a huger relief .
golf- of course .
and then u look the other direction and its the ocean !
of course we 're all in it for the money right ?
then we went to daves place to work on the calbot .
mainly i just bitched and whined to will .
i think she was half chinese ?
it tastes kind of strange , kind of like something ...
man arent we lazy- we cant even wash him ourselves !
oh well , she was way cool though .
anyway- hey friday i have a phone interview with microsoft !
we 're so jammed pack in three rooms ! !
man hello !
andy can get tickets for like half off .
i dunno , im just hoping they 'll push it back another week .
he was so cute !
sunday- man this was yesterday and im drawing blanks .
maybe get pedicures or something , those are always fun..
then we had a scavenger hunt 'with a twist'..
consume all of wills time .
def a fun day .
maybe if im on my best behavior..
so that was yesterday ( wednesday ) .
even i made it in there !
wed i worked .
anyway , today work went by pretty fast .
wow its been almost a week !
got ta get back into it quickly !
we also saw the little betelnut stands , where they have like these all window stands with bright neon lights and scantily clad women inside selling betel nuts .
lets see..
dont think im lame but something very exciting happened to me this morning ! !
but this semester i dont want to have to put in that much time towards humanities .
um..
what fun this weekend has been !
i started working there beginning of my sophomore year..
he couldnt replace the black beans..
the wedding party walked through everything while me/milan/chinson just hung out .
oh well !
haha .
so i got ta ace it !
he 's still sleeping !
disneyland !
i was still tired from the night before though , didnt feel that much like dancing .
even getting through the metal detectors took forever !
but i guess hey its pretty damn expensive !
but i dont complain to will about it .
11 years ago !
but anyway , the movie was long , but true to the book !
great ...
it was like a total of like $ 350 or something ?
basically just chill and hang out that night .
and we found out that this other friend of will 's is now expecting their second child !
i dont know why , but sometimes just hanging out and talking to a friend that you 're not like super close and just catching up and dishing is very stress relieving !
thats not teri and scott ... .
we 'll see .
the other salad vinagarette that is supposed to come with the other salad ! !
last christmas i got as a gift a shampoo/bath set form kiehls .
trial and error .
haha , yah kinda like when they were showing payback on tnt , that movie just isnt the same without all the profanity ! !
i dunno , its not that like its so much money u know ?
but anyway , i got home showered and took a nap .
im not sure if i want to go- im not that big of a clubber- especially cuz when i do go clubbing there 's always alcohol involved , and i dont know how much alcohol i can even stand to look at right now .
really nice and not rushed .
how annoying .
: ) ok ok bye bye !
they 're not even that expensive .
it was soo cool ! !
the plumber man is coming today .
i had a crazy dream yesterday .
( there were no cars in front of me ) .
definitely someone we 're really glad we got to meet and hang out with .
wanted to go somewhere else ! !
i bought a cover letter book so i can work on cover letters..
lets see , we picked up some pad thai ( from tuk tuk thai ) on the way down to santa clara for carolyn 's birthday , and ate in the car .
but still , some of these guys man ...
what to wear what to wear !
if it was in black ! !
: ) today is going to be a productive day ( i hope ) .
culprit ?
and then a cop drives by and is like , ok i radioed in , there should be a plow here..
still it was really really nice having everyone together .
after eating , we went back and i just lost straight for like 15 minutes .
i dont like too long hair- so maybe tomorrow i 'll go get it cut- maybe get highlights again .
you got it !
how exhausting for andy ( driver ! ) .
bye !
it was amazing how many caucasian people were there ! !
thats alot of money .
sunday morning .
i wan na be somewhere ! ! !
yes , cars !
: ) byeee !
then we headed out to north beach to go to chi-chis ...
and we 'll do some shopping together before heading home .
will is always saying hes a fake but after today he 's definitely not saying that anymore ! !
so we get there like 550ish , thinking maybe they closed at 6 ?
there was another girl in our group but shes in taiwan now- man do i miss her ! !
meeting at 2 to work on a project .
i think if i study my ass off tonight i should do ok..
guess which one is for who !
andy thought that he had lost his sunglasses , so after searching and searching , it turned out that they were in his pocket !
man ...
my friend from la is up this weekend- i think they 're going to go clubbing tonight but i dunno if i want to go- like i really want to hang out with her and stuff cuz i never see her and all- but i am really not a clubber- like i can say that i almost detest clubbing as much as i hate mushrooms and tofu .
down the beach more seems better- maybe better snorkeling ? - and move even farther down to the beach !
cuz we got to save it to blow when we go !
like its been over a week and if they didnt want me to come back then they 'd throw away my resume and why bother sending me this form ?
omg i sooo hope he is going to get that job .
seal the deal !
but pretty much will talked to the general general manager of oakland lexus and wanted bastard reprimanded , cuz shit they were this close to losing our business because of this guy ! !
oh yah- i got an email for a phone interview today for this position i applied for on monday .
yah but sat night we 're going to yoshis at jack london square for our friend 's birthday , i think he 's turning 27 !
i was so determined to get the dress picked out today , yet we were unsuccessful .
im still cold thinking about it .
and i know i like to buy brandname stuff and eat at expensive places , but thats all just icing on the cake .
i 've got 1 cs hmwk problem left too do , then i got ta get started on the cs project..
so anyway after that we went and did some shopping , i got a pair of pants and a top from nordstroms , and then tried out shoes .
blah .
then we went home and..
these berkeley run-down apartments have potential of well ...
but my lil sis jackie showed up !
yay its friday ! !
but we play again for different stakes..
but come to think of it- i never really explored any options of doing anything else- so what would i possibly look into ? ..
yum !
but if you wan na see a picture of her : urllink http : //www .
everything in my life always seems to come down to shopping..
we hit it off , had a lot of stuff to talk about and stuff .
like this semester just started right ?
to start out , last day of lecturing for our lean training !
we ask around about the cheapest place to rent snorkel gear- theres 3 main places- bossfrog , pacific divers and i forget the last one .
man im so stupid- my dad gave me the paperwork and told me to do it like 2 months ago !
can u believe it !
sunday morning we slept in , then cleaned the fishtank and bought more guppies !
i want out now !
and she laughs and says its because of her decoration , its not really that huge .
i think im going insane .
but alas it was not to be .
but anyway melinda found another fondue place in sf - called matterhorn or something ?
but will was my sugar daddy !
i think the new ones are today at 8/7 central !
good morning !
yay ! !
we didnt get home till like 4:30. rio came over and him and will each took a nap .
well actually will and i headed out early to the lexus dealership so we could drop off our car before they closed , and then they gave us a ride to the oakland airport , where we got to by like 6pm .
it feels good to actually pay for something..
and i was going to get bit but i wasnt scared ...
so now im supposed to be studying .
oh we got a table from one of my sisters- a table with 4 chairs .
like for me tylenol/advil never works by itself , i have to have a nap , no matter how short- in order for my headache to go away .
and im like- no- any beans except black beans- so he 's like no beans then ?
check in with yas laters !
happy friday !
need to catch up on my classes !
what else- ooh i got ta renew my passport too .
hm..
but thats nice , at least i get to sleep in !
its just strange because after moving away for so long , you just kind of think of your hometown as like , well ...
and look at the puppy ! !
we 're using sonar and infrared sensors and mikes and lights and a little broadcast camera !
it worked ! !
omg what an amazing great experience .
i 'm going to close for the rest of week- wed , thur and friday !
oh yes , this morning we took mojo to the vet .
my toes/fingernails are so perty .
and like the last guy , his stuff didnt come till like a good 45 minutes after my stuff came !
lots of time huh !
it was actually pretty fun .
im wondering if i want to ask some people if they want to go , or just go me and kareen- that might be just more relaxed ?
whatever the reason it was at first that caused those reactions , even if those feelings for some person may be gone but the song 's feelings are still there u know ?
for the rehearsal dinner- there were so many people and it like a full 10 course meal or something ! !
we had thai house for dinner- havent been there forever !
what 'd we do that night ?
but its ok , i had him preorder the new gameboy thats coming out too .
duck !
so we didnt even bother with number 2. but the commercials for # 3 looked somewhat humorous and with all the celebrities we figured it was worth a shot .
omg !
i think even when im old im going to love kate spade .
and good thing will was there cuz i got immediately annoyed and will was polite and was like , no she said not spicy ( which i for sure did ) and the the guy was like , well , you should specify next time not spicy at all and im thinking to myself ( what ! ! ?
all by myself too !
im here till 6 !
we went back home and fell asleep watching snl .
study .
argh ...
omg as i was driving to work today , i remembered the dream i had last night .
i dunno..
haha..
pearl harbor .
michael and stephanie went up first i think , me and will played more blackjack .
so at our table was will and carolyn ( who are getting married in august !
: ) that was pretty funny .
one of the wedding planner 's cell phone went off .
its so good seeing her again !
yes ...
servers didnt come back up until 3pm this afternoon .
so anyway- like the next year or so , i think we maybe talked on the phone/wrote letters ?
what do i do ?
i cant even remember the last time i went clubbing .
i have a midterm tomorrow morning .
byee !
im going to do 1-4 of ee143 ( review of midterm1 real fast ...
thursday was a pretty chill day .
so random .
omg i feel nauseous ... ..
and three !
lets see .
supposedly its really nice ?
pretty much , that entire vente frappacinno i drank got puked up .
so as uneventful as the night was- i accomplished my main goal- which was to hang out with my friend- and will didnt have to shell out $ $ for the cover and drinks for me .
no food here , justl ike jello and eggs .
he even let us look at them in the microscope !
there are girls worth befriending in eecs !
but anyway- gon na get some stuff done- and i 'll come back and elaborate more !
ooh my laptop is coming today..
saturday morning i woke up at 8am and washed up- dang it felt good to brush my teeth !
hm ...
one was everything i wanted in prettiness and the other one was everything i wanted in temperment !
not to be shallow- but i love to shop !
it was this guy and this girl , and i think they were kind of into each other , so we saw no big conflict .
i think i found a new route !
its newly expanded , so it should be exciting !
i might go snowboarding on sunday ! !
anyway , went to the dentist this morning .
the moods are not exactly happy happy .
wow it was huge and very grand !
i was looking at this application for this job and one of the questions were 'do you have fingerprints on file ' or something like that , and i thought the same thing- what a nice way to ask a question without straight out asking it !
even if hes sleeping or smelly from golf , i feel the most comfortable when we are together , when hes holding my hand .
this semester has been in stark contrast ; i dont remember a time this semester that i was like really happy ( ok well maybe acing that one midterm..
i think my job interview went ok today ?
so much for lots of money !
he thinks i unconsciously make a mess just so i can clean it up .
byee !
and i pulled it off its hooks , and left !
it should be fun .
its still different when he comes down vs. when i go up .
i think i just felt like winning something- usually im really good at monopoly and i always kick butt .
which is bad !
and im off at 6 and its like been a good day , and then all of a sudden , bamn a bazillion calls .
we know the outcome right ?
but im definitely going to attempt to play- and if not- i can always gossip with shirley in the golf cart .
im just procrastinating more .
1 ) as i already mentioned- took forever for the waiter to come 2 ) we had to get our own menus 3 ) we had to get our own utensils finally the waiter comes , and we order drinks and our food .
and now its been a year !
met lots of people .
what ! ?
by then the waitress is like speaking in korean to the chefs and its like very obviously they 're talking about us- not too pleasantly- probably about how annoying we are and stuff- and the waitress is like- well bla bla bla , bla bla , like really rudely , so we 're like fine- we 'll just sit at the bar !
when did she get there !
i need a real job .
doh !
then i saw a car in my rearview mirror that was behind me change lanes from a ways behind me and start speeding up .
so strange ... ..
the partay was fun !
am going to trade in my old gba for the new one that looks much cuter , seeing that i dont even play my gba cuz the lighting on it sucks and its so huge , hopefully this new one ( got ta trade in my old one + 60 bucks ) will be more enticing to play !
and i was like..
im starting clean today !
farther down the street..
yay we 're having tulips !
also , we checked out an asian florist and at first i didnt think we were really communicating what we wanted , but by the end of the visit- i felt she really saw eye-to-eye of what i wanted .
tiring but fun !
it was strange- i dunno how we finally figured it out ha ha .
like its really strange- the cold water is fine , lots of pressure .
we were talking about like 'sheesh ! '
can u believe that !
you should try it !
can we paint ?
september 18 regardless .
we 're headed down to santa clara for will 's friend 's will 's bday thingee..
and im like , hm , well i just had a piece of chicken , maybe thats more spicy than the actual noodles .
him and andy had a tee time at like 7:51 at this course in vallejo park .
argh !
be back later !
what did i do ?
yay !
serious , what great news huh !
its still there !
off goes the corvette .
lets see..
before i go into that though ( if i do ) , recap of a great memorial day weekend !
: ) so anyway- off to a productive day hopefully !
will got a pepper grinder from crate and barrel..
i have hope ! !
wow lakers kick ass .
pretty dang nasty huh !
i just got waken up !
i keep telling myself how great our lives are going to be when i finish school , but i realize in order to do that i better do good in my classes this last semester ! !
whats going on this weekend ?
considering its due today !
ooh there was this gay asian guy dancing by himself- he wasnt like bad looking u know ?
i think it 'll make it much easier to talk about and not forget things .
and of course im not printing directly ( cuz that would be crazy long ) but instead im copying into word documents and printing them out like 2 to each side , front and back , which is taking a long ass time .
and of course , theres a smoking section at the back of the boat near the bbq grills !
bleh !
yay ! !
but to help , at the end of each session i just took back my original money and gave my winnings to will , plus i paid for breakfast and dinner today !
man i 'm trying to check my balance in my bank account- but bofa .
i went out to the bathroom and buy some souvenir gear ( a blink182 sweatshirt , t-shirt and keychain ) .
but this time was just a big bummer !
i 'll try to be more interesting next time !
my first car accident !
: ) cuz i kick ass !
then we went back down .
the week was interesting .
i want to see celebrities ! !
lets just say it involves dressing up for halloween !
i 've decided that im going to drop my one and only cs course .
i am definitely going to try to enjoy things more !
we made the decision that i would go up to see him every weekend .
but well worth it !
this semester everything has been on hold due to my daily stress due to school ...
yum !
oh yes , and spent almost 2 days with one of my best friends shirley who is living there !
we had a chance to see some friends we hadnt seen in a while so it was cool .
i sure hope so- but if not..
then everyone came back to our place and the adults chatted and then us kids went to see love actually at covina 30. what is up with amc20 at puente hills not playing what we want !
no !
so i am no longer in debt !
catch up later !
hilarious ! !
by the time thursday comes around ( cs midterm ) it 'll be only 1 week till vegas so it should help me get through these agonizing times !
ahah , so i attempt a swing , and will is like , wow- that was a nice hit- as he watches a ball go soaring pretty far..
on the way dropping off one of our friends last night we stopped at hollywood video cuz will has these like rent up to 3 of anything for 99 cents each coupons .
hehe .
ugh !
every once in a while boats will sail by which is pretty cool , kayaks as well !
we 're going to hawaii end of september !
for some reason..
im so estactic !
like before i used to be kind of weary cuz i felt like i didnt really know that many of will 's friends , but after like 4 years , im definitely much more comfortable and at ease with them- they 're lots of fun ! !
i dunno , i think its too early in the month for me to be pms-ing though .
so crazy .
its strange i dont remember really what we did though .
will doesnt want to go into the water ...
diamond stud earrings ( finally heehee ) and platinum little hoops .
i didnt think the movie was as horrible as everyone said it was though .
i hate cs ! !
havent made plans , i should really get on it if i want to go out tonight..
off to cleaning my room .
still no job !
the worst thing is that its not even like a regular like presentation- its like i have to do it on something engineering-y..
i 'd just like to take this moment to gush on about what a wonderful boyfriend/fiance i have .
and theres like different equations and stuff , and in my dream last night , like i was on this journey of some sort going around and connecting all these equations together- and in the end- it came out to be exactly what it should be [ ? ] ...
but we had a hi tech burrito for lunch and by the time 9ish rolled by we were still stuffed and too lazy to go out to the city .
wow i was booking it to work this morning .
but overall impression- wonderful time !
but then it was like 930-10ish , and they were in long beach , and i got lazy .
like sure , theres this girl i know i think she 's been with her bf for like gosh knows how long , but like shes cheated on him numerous times , so like , i dont think that really counts .
we went to lexus and the dealer was so friendly .
am i strange or what , but the idea of making new curtains , or just like cleaning makes me happy !
we were talking about online journals today , and i was thinking , like , i dont ' really use this journal to like pour out my heart and soul and stuff , its more like just a diary/calendar , ehehe , so i can remember what we did on each day and stuff , cuz things start to blend together after a while .
ugh .
we 'll have a 4 day weekend !
yay ! !
afterward we dropped j off in san mateo we had some time to kill so we went to the barnes and nobles next to the hillsdale mall .
will loves zacharys so it 'll all work out fine .
yay the weekend is almost here !
what a weak mind ihave !
will planned on us leaving at 5 for tahoe , but for some reason the alarm didnt go off till 7..
its like 10x bigger than the other one !
she was so beautiful .
i have officially gotten sick of sims ...
then after that we went to skates- its our anniversary place to eat- and had desserts .
got ta pass got ta pass got ta pass ! ... .
) - they got subway and i got a wonton soup from sunhongkong which was 4 bucks !
it was really fun actually- my group was me , patrick , chris , alvaro and joe .
we didnt do much , played video games ?
she was way cool !
the guy next to me like breathed on me and i jumped a bit .
listening to music as i study hopefully .
medium length hair ! !
oh well !
when i think about our relationship im still wowed sometimes about how great it is .
but man it was raining hard , then getting higher , it was like a blizzard !
after 6 months , reunited we will be again !
oh well !
: ) we had our customary anniversary dinner at skates .
boy do i need a bigger place ! !
wednesday .
ahh..
and he did this little like cheering dance at the beginning- i guess cuz he had announced that the hmwk deadline would be postponed and people were probably cheering cuz they were happy..
yah can you say exhausted .
very very strange .
not that we never vaccuumed them , but our old dinky one couldnt get like hair and dust off of it .
i 've decided that i need a new purse .
then back to the hotel , and they have a tram that comes every like 10 minutes that takes us to disneyland !
dang kids are expensive !
big body , chunky legs .
and take a power nap and wake up and switch subjects to 143. all day tomorrow 143 cuz im sure monday im going to be panicking about 141 , then take the 141 final tuesday morning ( 8-11 ) , come home , power nap and do 143 rest of all monday ( maybe meet up to do practice finals ) and then tuesday morning take my 143 exam ( 8-11 ) ; power nap then do all day tuesday and wed 126 which i have the exam friday at 1230-330 !
my birthday !
ah the dilemnas in life i face .
i think life up here is definitely more slow and laid back..
cuz its so close , and i swear i didnt think it would take that long .
its the start of a nice weekend .
bar ?
and i was like , no i finished it..
wait i didnt mention- i got a part time job ! ! ! ! !
hung out with him and his roommate/friend/coworker dave .
still though ...
-return graduation gown -deposit check -passport stuff argh you 'd think with being done with school i 'd feel a load of stress off my chest .
no clue .
will on the other hand , had lots of fun with my fast-cashes at express men ( aka structure ! !
well i guess im going to try not to think about it .
ooh so we went to the driving range on monday , i was doing a lot better than last time !
i wish i was in another one ! !
yay its thursday !
me/kareen are chickens and jump off a lower cliff !
tuesday morning 730 i get to the offsite .
we 're going down to la today !
i want a kitty .
less spoiling of me ...
got in to john wayne airport like around 6ish ?
anyway , i wasnt feeling too hot .
its called poolanena ( sp ?
oh yes andy left his sunglasses in his car back at sfo so he got new sunglasses too !
something about getting something for nothing ...
so me and my best bud connie head over to the local mall and we each split a pair of earrings .
i dunno , i just think that before anyone has kids they should be in a stable and strong relationship and have like some sort of future going for them ...
: ) saturday was a pretty chill day , slept in till like 1ish- then a friend of ours came over and we had lunch and then walked around on telegraph .
it was pretty strenuous .
i saw in the daily cal yesterday that they 're looking for a hostess at this pool hall like down the street from where i live .
mojo must have missed us .
its something i want to become a part of , but the one meeting i 've been to seemed kind of stuffy .
so immediately i saw one i liked .
i 'm not sure what im going to get him for his bday though .
i just wasnt very excited .
ooh i got a b in my ee class !
haha , will def wouldnt like me puking in his lexus !
like the part with the ants..
i better go study right now !
im dropping a course so this dis i should definitely go to .
like there were no entries- its like crazy family style and recommended ordering of like 2-3 items per person ! !
oooohh ! !
but the other ?
10 seconds left , lakers down by 4 , seriously we all thought it was over .
vegas looks tentative .
yah !
yah but hey its an experience right ?
it was nice , 3 bedrooms and stuff , but of course we only used one .
the flight is delayed bout 20 minutes .
haha .
stupid friendster !
vegas at the end of the month ! !
at least it sure feels short compared to the 14 hours i was here yesterday !
ahhh what fun .
we 're at like a bookstore or something- and im looking to buy these 2 vc andrew books- and im surprised cuz will 's like ok. he 's there to meet like an old friend to interview her or something .
it was pretty crazy .
but anyway , it was fun .
hopefully by march .
so sad today on all my children .
i am just a really clean person !
but alas , i guess even i do n't sink that low .
but i got through it..
well not really , they were filled with incredible agony because of school , but wow i cant believe its like almost half over .
: ) ok yes- so thats what happened last night .
hm what else needs to get done- ah yes- 2 lab quizzes due tomorrow in lab- im meeting haleh at 8am tomorrow morning ...
maybe..
hehe .
but that would soon change !
byee !
anyway , it was fun like gossiping about people from high school .
then home again i went and hung out with my parents and watched a movie and stuff at home !
i still like the other law and orders better .
drive drive- and we get to this beach , which is like beachfront of this resort .
but will picked me home and got me into bed with advil and everything .
friday was 4th of july !
but the end result was worth it !
yay !
short hair though , which is good i guess .
hehe .
maybe not be so cocky ...
nothing i can do now but wait and see what happens .
sheesh .
like im sure theres lots to do , but im just not used to the whole living at home with my parents thing for too long- it drives me nuts to have to like be home at a certain time and stuff u know ?
i didnt finish it !
dropped off will at the airport today !
byeee !
its going to be lots and lots of fun !
im just grumpy .
oh well .
and she looks over at my plate and is like ...
i think i will talk about my trip once i get a cd burned with pix from kareen- she brought her digital and i didnt..
sometimes seriously i dont think people understand how freakin hard these courses are !
oh well next time !
man its going to be interesting , going with will 's parents and andy 's parents ! !
went to tanaka for dinner last night- mr tanaka was saying we should try their little crab thingees and we went over to look and i was pretty grossed out !
eck !
i suppose i def should call her asap to let her know- but i feel so guilty !
the movie was pretty amazing .
i think i 'll play some sims then study some more math .
but i managed to wake up later .
will took today off , i think we 're heading off with shirley/christian to eat at some place called fat apple in albany ?
creamy ? ...
and shes holding a pix straight out in front of me- argh- its a pix of like one of the guy 's head -all like contorted and ...
sucks !
so what did we do ?
and its so unfair for him , its surprising he 's still around . !
they must must win ! !
so we drove up yesterday after i got off work- took about 3 hours , and will booked a room at horizons casino- $ 29 bucks !
but oh well !
cost me like 3 times as much..
: ) oh yes , last week we had a quick last minute bday thingee for will on tuesday , talk about last minute i didnt decide to do it till like sunday night !
as corny as it is , i need will..
back home..
we go to treasure island and we have them like hold our stuff cuz its too early to check in and we go eat at like the food place there ( not buffet ) .
ok ?
dinner reservations at skates at 845 and then back to our place for more bomberman .
its 1am ...
then there were like single people there too , hmm lets see , i dont really remember everyone , but tim was the guy who set it up and he 's hella funny , oh and we gave his cousin susie a ride up from berkeley .
gambled more ! !
just down the street- but they 're much more expensive and everything is a la carte and will really wanted prime rib so we sat there and waited and waited and waited..
: ) 143 tomorrow morning ...
ok so the purpose of the excursion wasnt to exactly go shopping .
i just hope i dont bomb this one like my cs one .

hehe !
then i went on a crazy shopping spree , and i mean crazy .

even though it was hella hard , strangely enough i actually kind of enjoyed it !
anyway .
and headed back out to connie 's place .

and then h/p came over and we played bomberman while will took a nap !
afterwards we went to dennys yadda yadda and then we went home cuz will had to get to sleep early for this morning .

but it was worth it .

i would hate to be a really really old folgie still around when i didnt know anyone .
spring break is coming up .
i think pasadena to tustin is a long drive-..
i lost an hour last night !

but i guess b+ is still good , it 'd help my gpa regardless hehe !
let 's see .
i hate cleaning my room .
ack ! !
must have been because 1 ) it was night ( 7pm-1am ) so it was nice and cool and 2 ) we hardly had to wait for any rides !
i sure hope so !
i asked will today when we 're going to vegas again and i jokingly said 39 months ( when the car lease is up ) - and he didnt say anything !
