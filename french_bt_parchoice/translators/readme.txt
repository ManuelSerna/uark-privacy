Notes on using the translator files (as of Dec 6, 2020).

I used an anaconda environment with Python 3.8, the translators-api library, and the nodejs Linux runtime. I used the below reference to install translators-api, and I had to install nodejs with the command "sudo apt install nodejs".

Another thing of note, using the Bing API seems to work. It seems at the time that I am writing this, other APIs are not working for whatever reason.
